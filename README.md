# Hey!
My name is Petr Geršl and this is the code for my website. This is the fourth iteration of my website. No bloat, just the most important code.

# Why a fourth version?
My personal website was the first coding project I took on. At first, I intended it to be an everything site, however, that prooved difficult and I didn't have time to keep a blog. The second iteration was only a redesign and third split the functionalities of a single website into multiple. Now, the time has come to give it another serious makeover to suit my needs.
