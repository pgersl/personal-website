# Hey!
My name is Petr Ger≈°l and this is the code for my website. This is the third iteration of my website. No bloat, just the most important code.

# Why a third version?
The first version of my website was the first web-dev project of mine. It looked and worked horrible, so I decided to redo the design. Lately, I kind of lost interest in keeping basically a blogging website anymore, so this is why I am redoing this again.
