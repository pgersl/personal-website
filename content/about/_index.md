# Who?
My name is Petr Geršl. I'm a czech highschool student interested in chemistry, physics and music.
# What?
This is my website. It's a place on the internet just for me. I will use it to share my notes, thoughts, music and more. 
# Why?
I have decided to create this website in June 2022. The thought of making a website was in my head ever since my good friend [Vít Černý](https://vitcerny.xyz/) decided to do the same about a year earlier.
The main reasons I'm making this website are:  
- making sharing my notes easier
- exploring new fields (programming, web development, computer graphics, photo and video editing,...)
- creating a place where I could share my thoughts
- creating a place where I could share my music  
  
This site will hopefully help accomplish these goals and encourage me to learn new things.
