# Who?
My name is Petr Geršl. I'm a czech highschool student interested in chemistry, physics and music. I am currently attending [this school](https://www.cmgp.cz/). I don't particularly enjoy school, but I do enjoy learning new things. I think I am open-minded and can change opinions if presented with good arguments. I grew up in the Moravia region of the Czech Republic and love it here still.
# What?
This is my website. It's a place on the internet just for me. I am a fan of [internet independece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdKZVIGRAKQ&list=PL-p5XmQHB_JRRnoQyjOfioJdDmu87DIJc) and [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) so creating a website on which I could share things I create and share my progress in certain fields was a natural step in my personal development. I also don't like and don't use social media, so there would be no other way for me to do all these things.   
# Why?
I have decided to create this website in June 2022. The thought of making a website was in my head ever since my good friend [Vít Černý](https://vitcerny.xyz/) decided to do the same about a year earlier.
The main reasons I'm making this website are:  
- making sharing my notes easier
- exploring new fields (programming, web development, computer graphics, photo and video editing,...)
- creating a place where I could share my thoughts
- creating a place where I could share my music  
  
This site will hopefully help accomplish these goals and encourage me to learn new things.
