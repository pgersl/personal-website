As the first non-personal coding project of mine, I took on the administration of the website of my local church. I created a modern website that is easy to use and easy to navigate. I update it every week so that my local church-goers know when the masses are and what is happening in the church. I also add any new relevant information.

I do this all for free because I don't think taking money from the church like this is appropriate. I think of it as more of a handout.
