Together with a few friends of mine, I organized a competition for young students our age, to help them design an experiment for an international competition called [AstroPi Challenge](https://astro-pi.org/).

My job was to take care of and manage the finances for the project. Thanks to my work, we got support from several private companies in the field of space engineering and were able to offer the competitors a place to stay for the night and food so that they wouldn't have to bring their own.

During the event itself, I moderated the parts common to all the competitors, I took care of the ending ceremony and the registration. I also created a website for the project: [astropi-hackathon.org](https://astropi-hackathon.org/)
