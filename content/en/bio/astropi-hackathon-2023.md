Together with the same group of friends of mine, I again organized a competition for high schoolers. This year, we helped the participants come up with a method to measure the speed of the ISS for a new conception of the [AstroPi Challenge](https://astro-pi.org/) international competition.

My job this year was to secure enough money from our generous sponsors to secure enough food, merchandise and printing. I communicated with regional and city offices. I moderated the entire event and took care of the registrations.
