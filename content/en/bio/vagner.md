Vágner department store is a general department store business established more than a hundred years ago in 1907. The store sells office supplies and other stationery products, artistic supplies, gift assortment, more recently also toys.

I worked at Vágner for two summers as a sales assistant all over the store, mainly in the office supply department. My job was to keep my section in order and refill what was missing, protect the goods from stealers and offer support to customers who needed it.
