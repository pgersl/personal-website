St. Cyril and Methodius Grammar School and Pedagogical Secondary School are two schools under one roof. A grammar school with many awesome teachers and one of the few pedagogical secondary schools in the country. The students are incredible too, very active on top of the obligatory.

The school is one of the best in the country, with a clear vision and great leadership. The school is open to new possibilities and to communication with its students and employees.

I learned a lot at this school and met my best friends there. I am a part of a student administrative initiative and I organized several school events through it. I received support in my academic and artistic ventures.
