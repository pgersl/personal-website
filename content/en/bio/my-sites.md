My personal websites have gone through a few iterations by now, and I intend to keep making them better, both in terms of design and usability. I started with one simple website dedicated primarily to my notes, then ended up with three (personal, [music](https://music.pgersl.xyz/) and [notes](https://notes.pgersl.xyz)). My personal website is currently v.3 and the music and notes websites are v.2. Recently, I also created a [personal wiki](https://wiki.pgersl.xyz), which is going to be a work-in-progress project of mine for a while.

I code these websites entirely on my own. They are static sites and I use the [HUGO SSG](https://gohugo.io/) which parses markdown into HTML. I created all my templates from scratch. You can view all my code on GitHub. I also created a [website listing all my projects](https://projects.pgersl.xyz/) (even the ones not mentioned here) and also lists the old versions of this and other websites of mine.
