My personal websites have gone through a few iterations by now, and I intend to keep making them better, both in terms of design and usability. I started with one simple website dedicated primarily to my notes, then ended up with three (personal, [music](https://music.pgersl.xyz/) and [notes](https://notes.pgersl.xyz)). My personal website is currently v.3 and the music and notes websites are v.2. Récemment, j'ai ajouté un [site web wiki](https://wiki.pgersl.xyz), qui sera un projet en cours de développement pendant un certain temps.

I code these websites entirely on my own. They are static sites and I use the [HUGO SSG](https://gohugo.io/) which parses markdown into HTML. I created all my templates from scratch. You can view all my code on GitHub.
