During the second half of 2023, I worked on a paper about alkaloids and the use of modern methods of analysis to examine them. The paper is in Czech (full translation COMING SOON!).

I learned a lot from writing it and doing all the experiments for it. I did most of the experimental part on my own (with the help of a consultant), I found the sources myself and conducted the research by myself.
