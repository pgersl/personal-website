Terranova is a clothes shop, itself part of a larger company, [Solitaire](https://solitairesro.cz/) under [Teddy Group](https://www.teddy.it/en/home/). The company has a long tradition and focuses on modern and popular fashion products for men, women and children.

I worked at Terranova as a sales assistant for a little over two months as a summer job. My objective was to make sure my section of the store was tidy, helped the customers and protected the goods from being stolen.
