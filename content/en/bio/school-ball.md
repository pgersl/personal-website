My class organized a representation ball for my school. We had a lot of fun doing it and got positive feedback on it and we even made some money.

My job was creating a system for purchasing tickets for the ball, I designed a website and a system to gather the individual sales. I also integrated PHP backend my classmate programmed. The site is not online anymore. I tracked all sales and sold the tickets physically myself. I took care of the finances along with another one of my classmates. I also played one of the main roles of our thematic play.
