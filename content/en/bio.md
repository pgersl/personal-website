Petr Geršl was born on November 28, 2005, in Brno. From an early age, he has been devoted to music and science. He graduated from the Cyril and Methodius Grammar School and the Secondary Pedagogical School in Brno and is currently continuing his studies at the Faculty of Economics of the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice, where he studies Finance and Accounting.

During his time at grammar school, he focused on the study of chemistry. He passed the Advanced Placement Chemistry exam in English, completed Olga Ryparová’s chemistry course, and repeatedly took part in chemistry olympiads and other competitions, including the Secondary School Professional Activity (SOČ) with a project on the binding of alkaloids to stabilized structural anomalies in DNA, conducted under the auspices of the Faculty of Science of Masaryk University in Brno. Toward the end of his studies, however, his interest in chemistry waned, and he currently tutors chemistry only.

Upon entering grammar school, he gradually concluded his studies at the Primary School of Arts in Brno and began to focus on his own musical composition. He started writing his first works in 2021, at the time strongly influenced by the American composer Philip Glass and minimalist music—primarily solo piano pieces. His style gradually evolved and settled into music inspired by late Romanticism. By the age of twenty, he had composed several works for large orchestra, including three stylistically distinct symphonies, as well as pieces for smaller ensembles, choir, and several arrangements. His catalogue comprises just under 50 opus numbers.

Together with a group of friends, he also began organizing various events during grammar school. He helped organize the AstroPi Hackathon in Brno for three years and Zvaž vědu! in Brno for two years. He continues to organize these events to this day, focusing primarily on administrative tasks. In addition, while at grammar school he was involved in establishing and codifying a student self-governance organization. He also took on the role of librarian in Měnín, where he strives to involve the library more actively in the community life of the village.

In his final year of grammar school, he began studying economics and investment strategies, which shaped his future direction. After an unpleasant two-month internship at OVB Allfinanz, where he encountered the harsh reality of the unethical practices of some financial advisors, he sought another company where he could apply his knowledge and help people manage the stress associated with asset management. This led him to the Golden Gate group. At Golden Gate, he focuses on creating robustly diversified investment portfolios suitable for any economic environment, backed by a reputable firm.
