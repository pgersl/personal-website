I'm a [high school](https://www.cmgp.cz/) student from the Czech Republic. I'm interested in chemistry, music, linguistics, technology, economics and event organizing.

Right now, I only do part-times here and there, tutor a few students, run a debating club, write music and do some investing. I have experience in event organizing and have gone through several academic courses.
