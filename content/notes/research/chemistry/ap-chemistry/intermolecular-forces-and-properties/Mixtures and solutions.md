- **_solvation_** is the process of decomposition of a molecule due to its [intermolecular interactions](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/intermolecular-forces-and-properties/intermolecular-forces-and-properties) with other molecules
- **_solvent_** is any substance capable of _solvation_
- **_solute_** is any substance undergoing solvation
- **_solution_** is the mixture created by dissolving a solute in a solvent
# Molecule movement in a solution
- molecules in a solution orient themselves so that the charged particles (or dipoles) attract one another
- _polar solvents_ dissolve polar molecules
    - the molecules of solvent attack the molecules of solute and rip them appart forming micelle-like structures around the ions of the compound
# [Describing mixtures](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/composition-of-mixtures)
## [Mass percent/fraction](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/elemental-composition-of-pure-substances#mass-fraction-w) $w$
- it is the ratio of the mass of the solute to the mass of the solution

$$w=\cfrac{m_i}{m}$$

## Molarity $c$
- _molarity_ represents the number of moles of the solute in a volume of the solution
- it can be used to describe solutions which are hard to weigh
- it is prefered in most cases
- the base unit is $mol\cdot{dm^{-3}}$
    - it is usually written as just $M$

$$c=\cfrac{n_i}{V}$$

## Molality $b$
- _molality_ is the reation of the number of moles of the solute to the mass of the solvent
- it is widely used in biochemistry
- the base unit is $mol\cdot{kg^{-1}}$
    - is is usually written as just $m$

$$b=\cfrac{n_i}{m_s}$$

## Concentrating/Diluting a solution
- mass percent equilibrium

$$m_{i1}=m_{i2}$$
$$w_1m_1=w_2m_2$$

- molarity/molality equilibrium

$$n_{i1}=n_{i2}$$
$$c_1V_1=c_2V_2$$
$$b_1m_{s1}=b_2m_{s2}$$
