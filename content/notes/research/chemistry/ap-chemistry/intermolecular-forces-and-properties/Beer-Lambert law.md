- _Beer-Lambert law_ determines the realtionship between absorbance and concentration
    - whilst [absorption spectroscopy](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/intermolecular-forces-and-properties/spectroscopy-and-electromagnetic-spectrum#absorption-spectroscopy) gives us a qualitative result, Beer-Lambert law gives us a qantitative result
- formulation:

$$A=\epsilon{lc}$$
- where:
    - $A$ is _absorbance_, dimensionless
        - it is the result of absorption spectroscopy
    - $\epsilon$ is the _molar mass coefficient_, [$dm^3\cdot{mol^{-1}}\cdot{cm^{-1}}$]
        - it varies from wavelength to wavelength
    - $l$ is the _length of the cuvette_
    - $c$ is the _concentration_
- concentration can be thus calculated as:

$$c=\cfrac{A}{\epsilon{l}}$$
