# Standard conditions
- standard conditions are agreed upon by IUPAC
- _standard pressure_ is exactly $10,000\ Pa$
- _standard temperature_ is exactly $273.15\ K$
# Definitions
- **_ideal gas_** is a gas composed of molecules which do not interact with one another via [intermolecular forces](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/intermolecular-forces-and-properties/intermolecular-forces-and-properties) in any way
    - ideal gas cannot be condensed
    - it doesn't exist in the real world, some molecules do come close to it though
        - the molecules need to be very small and the intermolecular forces very week
        - $O_2$, $N_2$, $CO_2$ and $H_2$
- ideal gas interacts with its container, poushing in the walls resulting in _pressure_ $P$
- the _speed_ $v$ of the particles is directly proportional to the gas' _temperature_ $T$
- the size of the container with the gas determines its _volume_ $V$
- **_closed system_** is a system which doesn't exchange energy nor matter with its surroundings
# Preliminary laws
## Boyle's law (_Loi de Mariotte_)
- proven by Robert Boyle
> For a constant temperature, pressure is inversly proportional to the volume of the gas in a closed system.
> $$P=\cfrac{k}{V}$$
> $$PV=k$$

- at a constant speed of particles (temperature), if the volume shrinks, the number of collisions of the gas and the container must increase and _vice versa_
## Charles' law
- discovered by Jacque Charles
> For constant pressure, volume is directly proportional to temperature.
> $$V=kT$$
> $$\cfrac{V}{T}=k$$

- at a constant pressure, if we want to increase volume, we must also increase the speed of the particles (temperature)
## Gay-Lussac's law
- discovered by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac
> For constant volume, pressure is directly proportional to temperature
> $$P=kT$$
> $$\cfrac{P}{T}=k$$

- at a constant volume, if we want to increase pressure, we also need to increase the speed of the particles (temperature)
## Avogadro's law
- discovered by Amadeo Avogadro
> The volume of an ideal gas is directly proportional to the ammount of substance
> $$V=kn$$
> $$\cfrac{V}{n}=k$$
# Ideal gas law
- it is a combination of all already mentioned laws
$$\cfrac{PV}{nT}=k$$
- the constant $k$ is known as the **_unversal gas contant_** $R$ ($\approx{8.3145\ J\cdot{K^{-1}}\cdot{mol^{-1}}}$)
- since the constant is universal, a mixture of multiple different ideal gasses will behave as an ideal gas still
## Dalton's law
> The overall pressure of an ideal gas is the sum of the partial pressures of all the gasses.
> $$P=\sum_iP_i$$

- the partial pressure can be calculated as the product of the molar fraction of the gas and the overall pressure
$$P_i=x_iP$$
- also:
$$\cfrac{P_i}{P}=\cfrac{n_i}{n}$$
- the oressure and ammount of substance of whatever kind is virtually the same for an ideal gas
