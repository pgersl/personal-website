- **_intermolecular forces_** are all the different interactions between two molecules or atoms which do not [bond together](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/molecular-and-ionic-compound-structure-and-properties/types-of-chemical-bonds)
# Coulomb's force
- it describes the interaction between two particles based on their charge
- opposite charges are attracted towards one another, same charges are repelled from one another
- same charges do not interact via Coulomb's force
- Coulomb's forces can be also described as _ion-ion interactions_
# Van der Waals forces
## London dispersion forces
- it descrbies the interaction of two molecules that do not have a [dipole](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/molecular-and-ionic-compound-structure-and-properties/types-of-chemical-bonds#partial-charge)
- they are the results of temporary dipoles
- **_instantaneous dipole_** occurs when in a non-polar molecule electron density is higher closer to one of the bonding partners
    - this is caused by the constant movement of electrons
    - in the moment instantaneous dipole occurs, the molecule is very slightly polar
- instantaneous dipoles can cause the induction of dipoles in other molecules surrounding it, thus creating **_induced dipoles_**
- London dispersion forces are therfore _instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions_
- the strength of these interactions rises with the propability of creating an instantaneous dipole, which rises with the number of electrons
- they can be found between all molecules and atoms
## Debye forces
- it describes the interaction of two molecules, one which does not have a dipole and one which does
- **_permanent dipole_** exists in all polar molecules
- permanent dipoles can induce dipoles in other non-polar molecules
- Debye forces are therore _permanent dipole-induced dipole interactions_
- Debye forces occure for example between a molecule of water and an oxygen molecule
    - fish can breath under water thanks to this
## Keesom interactions
- it descries the interaction of two molecules that both have a dipole
- they are therefore _permanent dipole-permanent dipole interactions_
### Hydrogen bond
- it is a special case of the Keesom interactions
- it forms between a hydrogen of a polar compound and the negatively chrged end of another pole molecule
- it strongly influences the physical properties of different substances
## Ion-dipole interaction
- ions can interact with permanent dipoles rather easily
- it occurs in solutions, where a polar solvent interacts strongly with ions of salts
    - it results in disolution of the salt, as the molecule is ripped appart
