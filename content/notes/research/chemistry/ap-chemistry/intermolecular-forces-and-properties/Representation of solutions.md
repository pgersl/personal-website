# Dissociation and reaction schemes
- _dissociation_ is a chemical reaction in which a molecule is broken up into its individual parts
- chemical reactions can be represented in _rection schemes_
    - rection scheme of a dissolution in water: $AB(s)\overset{H_2O}{\longrightarrow}Na^+(aq)+Cl^-(aq)$
    - the state of the compounds can be represented using letters in brackets behind the formula
        - $(s)$ - solid
        - $(l)$ - liquid
        - $(g)$ - gas
        - $(aq)$ - aqeous solution
    - the substance that causes the reaction to happen (_reactant_) is often placed **above** the arrow
    - the substance that is produced during the reaction but is unimportant for further continuation of the reaction is often placed **under** the arrow
- when no more substance can be disolved, we call it the _point of saturation_
# Electrolytes
- _electrolyte_ is a substance the solution in a polar solvent of which conducts electricity
    - oposite is _nonelectrolyte_
    - _strong electrolyte_ dissolves fully and easily in a polar solvent
        - an example is sodium chloride $NaCl$
        - they are formed by strong acids and strong bases
        - dissolution of sodium chloride in water:        
            $$NaCl(s)\overset{H_2O}{\longrightarrow}Na^+(aq)+Cl^-(aq)$$
    - _weak electrolyte_ doesn't dissolve properly or in its entirety in a polar solvent
        - an example is sodium fluoride $NaF$
        - they are formed by weak acid and strong base, strong acid and weak base or weak acid and weak base
        - they alter the pH of the solution
        - dissolution of sodium fluoride in water
            $$NaF(s)\overset{H_2O}{\longrightarrow}Na^+(aq)+HF(aq)+OH^-(aq)$$
# Effects on solubility
- the amount of disolved salts rises with the rising temperature
    - the increasing temeprature weakens the bonds in the solute, thus making it more susceptable to dissolution
    - higher speeds of molecules of the solvent make it easier to break up crystal lattices
- the amount of disolved gas decreases with the rising temperature
    - the higher speed of the molecules of the solute make it easier to break from the attractive forces of the solvent
