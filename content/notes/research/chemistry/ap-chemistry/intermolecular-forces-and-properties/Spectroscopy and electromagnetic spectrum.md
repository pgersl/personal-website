# Absorption spectroscopy
- it uses the fact that each atom has a different electron shell and thus all absorb different wevelengths
- a spectrometer consists of a few parts:
    - _source_
        - it is a source of white light
        - the source should have a broad span of white light and should be as stable as possible
        - some sources also generate electromagnetic radiation of shorter or longer wavelengths beyond visible light 
    - _monochromator_
        - it is a set of three parts: _entrence slit, dispersion device, exit prism_
        - the white light passes through the entrence slit
        - it then hits a prism which seperates the white light into its different components
        - a narrow band of wavelengths is passed through the exit slit
        - the prism then turns to pass different wavelenghts onto the exit slit
    - _sample_
        - the light from the monochromater then passes through our unknown sample
    - _detector_
        - it detects whether light was or wasn't passed through the sample and records it into a computer file
- the results is called an **_absorption spectrum_**
