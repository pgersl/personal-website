# Different forms of [the ideal gas law](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/intermolecular-forces-and-properties/the-ideal-gas-law#ideal-gas-law)
- the ammount of substance in the ideal gas law can be rewritten using the number of particles:
$$PV=Nk_BT$$
- where $k_B$ is the _Boltzmann constant_
    - its value is approximately $1.380648\cdot{10^{-23}J\cdot{K^{-1}}}$
    - universal gas constant is the product of multiplying it and the avogadro constant
$$R=N_Ak_B$$
# Relation of temperature to the speed of particles
- the mean speed of particles follows Maxwell-Boltzmann propability distribution
    - the equation counts the propability that a particle with three properties (mass, speed and temperature) exists
    - it is usually denoted as the propability $\mathbb{P}$

$$\mathbb{P}(m,v,T)=\sqrt{\left(\cfrac{m}{2\pi{k_BT}}\right)^3}\cdot{4\pi{v^2}e^{-\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}}}$$

- the velocities of the particals of a gas are not the same everywhere
- the lower the temperature, the higher propability of particles moving is similar speeds
- the higher the temperature, the higher the mean velocity of the particles
- the lower the mass, the higher the mean velocity of the particles
- the mean kinetic energy of the particles can be derived from the propability equation above

$$E_k=\cfrac{mv^2}{2}=\cfrac{3k_BT}{2}$$

- at constant temperature, if we want to echange a light element for a heavier one, the kinetic energy must stay the same and the velocity drops
- at constant velocity, if we want to exchange a light element for a heavier one, the kinetic energy must rise as does the temperature
# Diffusion
- it is the spontaneous mixing of two substances
- the higher the temperature or the lower the mass, the faster the diffusion
# Effusion
- it is the process of a gas leaving a container with a hole in it
- the faster the particle, the faster the effusion
## Graham's law
- it desribes the rates of effusion in a mixture of two gasses

$$\cfrac{r_1}{r_2}=\sqrt{\cfrac{M_2}{M_1}}$$

- $r$ is is the rate at which the gas escapes the container
    - it is proportional to the velocity of the particles
