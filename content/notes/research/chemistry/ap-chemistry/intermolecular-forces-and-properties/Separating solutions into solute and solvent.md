# Evaporation
- a solution is heated up and the solvent is boiled of leaving the solute in a crystallizzed form
- should there be more solutes, the result will be the mix of them
- should the solute be thermically unstable, evaporation should not be used
- it is usually done under low pressure to lower the boiling point of the solvent

# Crystallization
- a solvent is heated up and the solute is then added to the point of saturation; the mixture is left to cool and is left to cool down
- it is primarily used as a purification step
    - products can be very pure
- it is primarily used in organic chemistry to purify water soluble substances

# Filtration
- a solution is passed through a porous barrier (_filter_) which removes any hard solids from a solution
- it is primarily used as a purification step, but can also be used as a separation technique
- _permeate_ (_filtrate_) is the substances which goes through the filter (usually the goal)
- _retenate_ (_residue_) is the substance which stays on the filter (usually the waste)

# Chromatography
- it is a method of analysing a solution
- an _absorber solid_ (_stationary phase_) with a sample (a drop of ink for example) is sunk into a solution (_mobile phase_)
- the solution will rise up due to the capillary action and the individual constituents will slow down based on their polarity
- the drop of ink will spread and show many colors as the different constituents stop at different places of the stationary phase

# Distillation
- a solution is heated; as the liquids with different boiling points boil, they are liquified again in a condenser and seperated into a different conatiner
- if there are more liquids to be seperated, we call them _fractions_
    - the process is then called _fractional distillation_
        - it is primarily used in petrochemistry and making alcohol
- the vapor is liquified by cooling it down using cold water in most cases
