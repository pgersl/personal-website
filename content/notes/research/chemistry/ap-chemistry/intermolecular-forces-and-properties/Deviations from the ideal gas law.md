- [the ideal gas law](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/intermolecular-forces-and-properties/the-ideal-gas-law) is an approximation for the real world gasses
# Compressability
- the ideal gas law neglects the volume of the gas and its changing properties based on it
- at low enough pressure, it is almost absurd speaking of a volume of gas when the molecules of it are so far apart
- an ideal gas can be compressed infinitely and it never condenses
- at high enough pressure or temperature, the propability of collision of two molecules rises significanly and thus the volume of the gas cannot be neglected anymore
- gasses thus have a property called _compressibility_ $z$

$$z=\cfrac{PV}{nRT}$$

- gasses behave almost ideally only at certain conditions, from molecule to molecule
# Van der Waals equation
- derived by Johannes Diderickk van der Waals
$$\left(P+\cfrac{an^2}{V^2}\right)\cdot{(V-nb)}=nRT$$
- the volume of the container is reduced by the volume of the molecules $nb$
    - $b$ represents a constant, the volume of one mole of the gas molecules
- the pressure is lowered due to attractive forces of molecules
    - $a$ is a constant derived experimenally
