# Amorphous solids
- they don't have a crysalline latice
- the particles can move around rather freely, but not as freely as to allow free flow
- they are malleble but also fragile
- melting point cannot be easily measured, since the increase in flow is constant
## Glass
- glass is a specific form of amorphous solids
- it is mostly amorphous but also contains parts of crystalline strcutred molecules
# Crystalline solids
- they have a crystalline latice
- the particles are clearly ordered
- they tend to be rather strong but brittle
## Quasicrystalline solids
- these solids seem to have some repeating patterns in their structure, but no in the entire solid
- they commonly have fractal paterns
# Molecular solids
- they are made of molecules interacting together only via [intermolecular forces](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/intermolecular-forces-and-properties/intermolecular-forces-and-properties)
- they are very soft and have low melting points
- they can be either amorphous or crystalline 
# Covalent solids
- the individual particles are held together via covalent bonds
- they are very hard, have high melting points
- they are generally bad conductors
    - it can be changed by introducing an impurity
- they can be either amorphous or crystalline
- all of these solids can be combined together
