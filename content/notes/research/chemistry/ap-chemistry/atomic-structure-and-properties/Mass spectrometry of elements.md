# History of mass spectrometry
- mass spectrometry was developed in a laboratory under the supervision of Hermann von Helmholtz
- Eugene Goldstein, a student of von Helmholtz's, discovered that when current flows through a perforated cathode, the holes emant a faint but visible radiation

- the observed particles were studied by Wilhelm Wien, another student of von Helmholtz's
    - he constructed a _velocity selector_ (Wien's filter)
    - he was able to move the canal ray and using the curvature, he calculated the exact mass of the particle constituting the canal ray
    - the particle was later named _proton_
# Calculating mass using the curvture of the flightpath of a charged particle
- within any point of the path of the charged particle, there exists an equilibrium of _electromagnetic force_ (moving the particle from a straight path) and _centrifugal force_ (reacting to the electromagnetic force)
$$F_{electromagnetic}=F_{centrifugal}$$
thus:
$$zvB=\cfrac{mv^2}{r}$$
where
    - $z$ is _charge_
    - $v$ is _velocity_
    - $B$ is _magnetic field strength_ (in a vacuum)
    - $m$ is _mass_
    - $r$ is _radius_
- rearraning the formula mentioned above we get:
$$m=\cfrac{zBr}{v}$$
- the mass we get from the above written calculation is the atomic mass of an element
    - it is usually denotated as $m/z$
    - it has the unit called _Dalton_ (_Da_)
    - _relative atomic mass_ is different from _atomic mass_, since atomic mass represents the mass of a single isotope
        - relative atomic mass does not have a unit
# Reading results of mass spectrums
- the results of mass spectrum meassurements are usually ploted on a graph with the y-axis representing relative intensity and the x-axis representing $m/z$
- if only one isotope of an element is present in a sample, we only see one peak
- if there are multiple isotopes present in the sample, we se multiple peaks
