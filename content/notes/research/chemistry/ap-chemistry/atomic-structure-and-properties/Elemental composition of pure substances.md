# Denoting elements
- writing down the composition of paticles combines using letters (the symbols of elements) and numbers
- numbers are written in four indexes around the symbol of the element
    - top right index denotes the _overall charge_ of the prticle
    - bottom right index denotes the _number of atoms_ constituting the particle
    - bottom left index denotes the _number of protons_
    - to left index denotes the _overall number of nucleons_
        - it is also reffered to as the _mass number_
- ex. $_8^{18}O_2^{-1}$ - _dioxygen-18 (-1) anion_
# Denoting pure substances
## Structural formula
- _structural formulae_ denote every atom and bond of the substance
    - some formulae also add free electron pairs
- ex.

- the structural formula is sometimes _condensed_
    - groups of distinct physical or chemical properties are written together
- ex. Condensed strucural formula of hydrogen peroxide
$$HO-OH$$
- it is most used in organic chemistry 
## Molecular formula
- _molecular formulae_ denote only the numbers of atoms in the substance
- it is most used in inorganic chemistry
