- periodic table of elements is organized in a way that some properties of the elements can be read simply by looking on the table
# Highest energy valence orbitals
- periodic table is devided into four blocks
- see [here](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/atomic-structure-and-electron-configuration#writing-electron-configuration)
# Atomic mass
- the more nucleons an atom has, the higher its atomic mass
- **the further down and to the right we go in the periodic table, the higher the atomic mass** 
# Atomic radius
- the more protons an atom has, the bigger the pull on the electrons around it, hence a smaller atomic radius
- the atomic radius decreases in periods, since the electrons are on one energy level (in the same distance) from the nucleus
- the atomic radius increases in groups, since the outermost electrons are further from the nucleus, because they are on a higher energy level
- **the further down and to the left we go in the periodic table, the higher the atomic radius**
# Ionic radius
- the ionic radius shrinks when electrons are removed and it grows when they are added for the same reasons atomic radius behaves the way it does
- the ionic radius is going to be larger the bigger the difference between the number of electrons and the number of protons gets
# First ionization energy
- **_first ionization energy_** is the energy needed to remove one (the outermost) electron of an atom

- atoms are most stable when their valence orbitals are either full or half-full
    - noble gasses have the highest first ionization energies, because they have their valence orbitals full and thus don't want to give them up
    - alkali metals are only one electron away from reaching a full orbital one energy level lower and thus are glad to give the one electron up
    - elements like nitrogen have their valence _p_-orbital half-full and thus halfway to having a full _p_-orbital or a full _s_-orbital, which means they are rather stable and wont give up their electrons as easily as elements like oxygen or fluorine
- **the further up and to the right we go in the periodic table, the higher the first ionization energy**
# Electronegativity $\varkappa$
- **_electronegativity_** is the tendency of an atom tu pull electrons of a chemical bond towards itself
- it is related to first ionization energy and _electron affinity_
    - _electron affinity_ is the tendency of an atom to keep its electrons in its electron shell
- electronegativty can be calculated as:
$$\varkappa=\cfrac{E_I+E_{EA}}{2}$$
- where:
    - $E_I$ is the _first ionization energy_
    - $E_{EA}$ is the _electron affinity_
- **the further up and to the right we go in the periodic table, the higher the electronegativity**
