- **_valence electrons_** are the electrons located in the outermost shell of an atom
    - these electrons are able to interact with valence electrons of other atoms to form bonds
- in an extreme situation, where a very electronegative and a very electropositive element meet, the electronegative element will rip electrons of the electropositive element and ions are formed
    - an ionic bond between these two elements is esablished
        - the ions are held together by basic electrostatic forces
    - the electronegative element is usually a non-metal
    - the electropositive element is usually a metal
    - both elements forming an ionic bond benefit by getting themselves into a more stable [electron configuration](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/atomic-structure-and-electron-configuration#electron-configuration)
    - ionic compounds have a distinct structure and they form large crystals
        - for their description, we use the [empirical formula](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/elemental-composition-of-pure-substances#empirical-formula)
