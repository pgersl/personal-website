# Avogadro constant $N_A$
- _Avigadro constant_ specifies the ammount of particles in a mole of any substance
$$1\ N_A=6.022\cdot{10^{23}}\ mol^{-1}$$
- it is defined as the number of atoms in precisely 12 grams of $^{12}C$ isotope
# Mole of a substance $mol$
- a _mole_ is precisely the Avogadro contant number of particles
- with the weight of an atom, the wieght of a mole increases
- the number of moles of a substance is called _ammount of substance_ $n$
# Molar mass $M$
- _molar mass_ is the weight of one mole of a substance
- molar mass of an atom is derived from the relative atomic weight (which can be found in the periodic table)
    - _relative atomic weight_ $m_a$ has specifies the weight of a mole of a substance composed only of single atoms
    - molar mass specifies the weight of a mole of a substance composed of either single atoms or molecules
- molar mass of a molecule is the sum of relative atomic weights of its individual atoms
$$M=\sum{m_a}$$
# Relationships
- calculating the mass of a substance
$$m=n\cdot{M}$$
- thus:
$$n=\cfrac{m}{M}\ \ \ M=\cfrac{m}{n}$$
- calculating the number of particles $N$ of a substance
$$N=n\cdot{N_A}$$
- thus:
$$n=\cfrac{N}{N_A}\ \ \ N_A=\cfrac{N}{n}$$
