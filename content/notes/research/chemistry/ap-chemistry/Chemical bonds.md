- **_chemical bonds_** are lasting attractions between two atoms
- chemical bonds can be established between two atoms which do not have their valnce electron shell completely filled
    - _noble gasses_ (helium, neon and argon primarily) are thus very unreactive and form only a very small number of compounds
- chemical bonds form in three differnet ways:
    1. **electron sharing** - _covalent bonds_
    2. **elecrostatic attraction** - _ionic bonds_
    3. **electron transfer** - _donor-acceptor bonds_
    - in all of these cases, the atoms which constitute the bond are as close as possible to the most stable electron configuration of the noble gases
- bonds can be devided into two categories by force:
    - **strong/primary** - the bonds mentioned above and in detail explained below
    - **weak/secondary** - [intermolecular forces](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/intermolecular-forces)
# Intramolecular force
- **_intramolecular force_** is an attraction or any force in general that is formed between two atoms within a molecule
    - intramolecular forces include [covalent and ionic bonds](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/molecular-and-ionic-compound-structure-and-properties/types-of-chemical-bonds)
## Bond length and energy
- **_bond length_** is the distance of the two nuclei of the bonding partners
    - it is usually meassured in _ångströms_ ($1Å=10^{-10}m$)
- **_bond energy_** is measures the bond's strength and how much energy is needed to destroy it
## Bond formation
- as the bonding partners are moving closer together, the potntial energy of the system changes
- when the atoms are distant, the attraction is practically non-existent
- with distance, the energy of the system decreases and thus the system becomes much more stable
- at a point when the attractve force is the same as the rpulsive force of the two atoms, the energy of the system reaches the smallest point and a bond is formed
    - the bond length is determined here also
- energy needed to seperate the atoms can be seen
- if the atoms were moved even closer together, the enrgy of the system increases rapidally

{{< fig class="note-fig" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FPetrGersl%2FDAKDlhv00S.png?alt=media&token=d91afed8-9a59-4833-99cd-4769955a19af" alt="Bond enegy as the function of distance between nuclei" >}}

- the energy needed to dissociate the bond partners increases as the bond length gets shorter
    - triple bonds will thus be much stronger than single bonds
    - energy of the bonds with larger atomic readii will be smaller
- bonds get stronger in this order: metalic - non-polar covalent - polar covalent - ionic
# Covalent bonds
- **_covalent bonds_** are created between atoms when it is most stable fo them to share electrons
- one, two, three or more _electron pairs_ (one electron belonging to each bonding partner) can be shared to form single, double, triple or higher-multiplicity bonds respectively
    - the attraction between is stronger with more electron pairs shared
    - single, double and triple bonds are the most common in the nature
        - higher-multiplicity bonds occure only between lanthanides and actinides
- the bond is formed via an overlap or a strong attraction of orbitals of the bonding partners
## $\sigma$ bonds
- $\sigma$ bodning occurs when orbitals overlap

{{< fig class="note-fig" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FPetrGersl%2FF0hbIYBPHR.png?alt=media&token=933783e4-1bb0-4158-9d11-752e134d48fa" alt="Examples of orbital overlap" >}}

- the orbitals overlap along the internuclear axis (nulceus-nucleus)
- electron density between the two bonding partners is symmetric
- they are the strongest bond between two atoms
## $\pi$ bonds
- $\pi$ bonding occurs when orbital overlap on a parallel to the internuclear axis or when they are strongy attracted towards one another
- the electron density is highest above and below the plane of the intermolecular axis
- $\pi$ bonds are formed in double, triple and higher-multiplicity bonds, the single bond is always a $\sigma$ bond
## The role of electronegativity
- electronegativity plays a part to the covalent bond as well
- the result of bonding of two atoms of different negativites is that the more electronegative bartner attracts the shared electrons more than the more electropositive bonding partner
- this means that some parts of the molecule are _partially charged_
### Partial charge
- **_partial charge_** - $\delta$ - can be either positive - $\delta^+$ - or negative - $\delta^-$
    - the bonding partner with higher electronegativity will have a negative partial charge
    - the bonding partner with lower electronegativity will have a positive partial charge
- molecules with significant differences of partial charges are called _polar_
- molecules with insignificant or no partial charges are called _non-polar_
- if partial charges exist, the bonding partners form an _electric dipole_
    - this plays a massive role in the intermolcular forces between different electric dipoles and it influences the properties of the molecule
- in one molecule, there can be more electric dipoles influencind one another
    - the polarity of a molecule depends on where the electric dipoles are and the molecule's geometry
    - if the the strenghts of the dipoles is equal and the dipoles are directly oposite to one another, the molecule is overall non-polar
### Differences of electronegativites
- the difference in electronegativities of the bonding partners determines how polar the bond is
    - if the difference is low, the bond is less polar
        - this is when the difference is less than 0.4
    - if the difference is rather high, the bond is more polar
        - this is when the difference is in a range from 0.4 to 1.7
    - if the differnece is really high, the bond is probably not longer covalent but ionic
        - this is when the difference is higher than 1.7
# Ionic bonds
- **_ionic bonds_** are created between atoms when it is most stable for them to give up electrons
- typically, ionic bonds are formed between metals and non-metals
- electrons of the bond partners are transfered
    - the transfer leads to creation of two oppositely charged particles
    - one partner loses one or more valence electrons and a _cation_ is formed
    - on partner gains one or more valence electrons and a _anion_ is formed
- the electron configurations of the bodning partners reach as close as possible to the electron configuration of noble gases
    - the _octet rule_ states that an atom is most stable when all of its valence orbitals are filled (with eight electrons exactly)
    - the _duet rule_ states that it is more stable for an atom to have to atoms in its valnce shell rather that more or less
- ionic compounds have a distinct structure and they form large crystals
        - for their description, we use the empirical formula
- hence, there are two conditions for an ionic compound to be formed:
    1. **_The stability rule_** - the atom must adhere to the octet or duet rule
    2. **_The neutrality rule_** - the created ionic compound must be neutral and the charges of the ions forming the bond must be balenced out
## Structure of ionic solids
### Crystaline structure
- the anions and cations of the ionic compound together create a lartger three-dimensional structure - **_crystaline structure_**
- the structure is highly regular and forms an _ordinal latice_
- one ionic compound can have more than one crystline structure
#### Lattice energy
- the ions together in this crystaline structre are minimazing the _lattice energy_
- it is the energy of the repulsion and attraction between individual ions
    - the attractive forces are at maximum whilst the repulsive forces are at minimum
- it influences many properties of the compound - solubility, hardness, volatility
    - ionic compounds are usually very hard but brittle
    - they also have very high melting points
- the smaller atomic radii and higher the charge, the higher the lattice energy
- the higher the melting point of an ionic solid, the higher the lattice energy
#### Valence shells
- electrons in the valence shells are _localized_ (unlike in [metalic bonds](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/molecular-and-ionic-compound-structure-and-properties/intramolecular-force-and-potential-energy#metalic-bond))
- ionic compounds show very low electric and heat conductivity
- when ionic compounds are heated, the valence shells don't start to overlap, but the conductivity is still higher, because the ions themselves are able to carry the charge
## Coulumb's law
- the interaction between ions in a crystalline lattice can be described using the Coulumb's law
- the interaction strength can be approximated using:

$$E=k\cfrac{Q_1Q_2}{d}$$

- where:
    - $E$ is the _interaction strength_
    - $k$ is the _Coulumb's constant_ ($=8.99\cdot{10^{-9}}\ Nm^2C^{-2}$)
    - $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the _charges of the particles_
    - $d$ is the _distance between atomic nuclei_
- the overall energy of the interactions is equal to the sum of the energies between all atoms and their combinations in the lattice
    - for $NaCl$ that is:

$$ E=E_{Na^+Cl^-}+E_{Na^+Na^+}+E_{Cl^-Cl^-}=\cfrac{-k}{d_{Na^+Cl^-}}+\cfrac{k}{d_{Na^+Na^+}}+\cfrac{k}{d_{Cl^-Cl^-}}$$

# Metalic bond
- **_metalic bond_** is a special type of bond
- it is created in polymeraic structures of metal crystals
- the orbitals of these metals overlap a lot and all the electrons of these overlapping orbitals are shared in the whole crystal creating the _electron gas_
## Structure of metals and alloys
### Pure metals
- metals usually have a much higher number of electrons in the highest enrgy orbitals due to the electrons in _d_-orbitals and in _f_-orbitals
- electrons are _delocalized_ in metals and can flow almost freely through the whole lattice
- metalic bond explains many characteristics of metals
    - _ductility, melleability_
        - the individual layers of the metalic lattice and theit delocalized electrons are able to easily slide when external force is applied
    - _heat conductivity, electric conductivity_
        - the free movement of electrons enables very easy transfer of charge, thus the trasnfer of heat and electricity
    - _high melting and boiling points_
        - the attraction of the ions and electrons together is very strong
### Alloys
- **_alloys_** are mixtures (or combinations) of two or more metals
    - they sometimes have other elements added as well
- the metal that composes the majority of the alloy is called the _base_
- the metal that is added to the base metal is called the _dopant_
- these combinations of different elements change the properties of pure elements
    - the properties of the alloy can be changed by adjusting its composition
    - the properties resulting from alloying include strength, hardness, durability and resistence to corrosion
#### Substitutional alloys
- **_substitutional alloys_** are those alloys, where the atoms of the dopant are very similar in size to the atoms of the base metal
- the atoms of the dopant simply substitute the atoms of metal in the lattice
- the final structure can be very similar to that of a pure metal
- examples: _bronze,  brass_
#### Interstitial alloys
- **_interstitial alloys_** are those alloys, where atoms of the dopant are rather different in size to the atoms of the base metal
- the dopant's atoms are usually smaller
- the atoms of the dopant fill out the empty spaces (_intersices_) between the metalic cation of the crystaline latice
- the positions of the atoms of the dopant strongly influence the alloy's properties
# Lewis structures
- _Lewis strctures_ (_Lewis diagrams_ or _Lewis electron dot diagrams_) enable us to write the role of every valence electron in a chemical bond
## Lewis symbols
- electrons are represented as dots on the sides of the symbol of an element
    - electron pairs are represented as a double dot or more commonly with a line
    - typically, it does not matter on which side the unpaired electrons end up, but if there are more than one, the should be on the oposite side
    - only valence electrons are included (the orbitals in which they are do not matter)
- ex. Lewis diagram of an oxygen atom - $\cdot\underline{\overline{O}}\cdot$
- the dots can be used to ilustrate ionistion reactions more easily
    - ex. Lithium loosing its electron - $Li\cdot\longrightarrow{Li^++e^-}$
## Octet rule
- it is most stable for elements to have eight valence electrons in their valence shell
    - exceptions are the atoms closer to Helium, where it is most stable for them to have only two electrons in their valence shell (_duet rule_)
- atoms achive this usually via bonding
    - the shared electrons count to the number of electrons in both participants' valence shells
- these stable atoms can be written using the Lewis diagrams as $|\underline{\overline{X}}|$
### Exceptions
- _molecules with odd numbers of electrons_
    - sometimes, it is natural for radicals (substances with one or more unpaired electrons) to occur naturally
    - no multiplicity of the bond enables them to have the electron octet
    - ex. $NO$ - $\cdot\overline{N}\equiv{O|}$
- _over-filled octets_
    - sometimes, central atoms have more than eight electrons in their valence shell after bonding
    - this occurs with elements that can create complex compounds  with other types of bonds
- _under-filled octets_
    - sometimes, the central atom's most stable arrengements are more simple and with less valence electrons than the octet rule suggests
    - in these compound, new interesting types of bonding occure
## Ionic Lewis dot structures
- Lewis structures of ionic compounds can clearly show where electrons were transfered in a compound
- the ions are usually written in a square parathesis [] with their charges written
- ex. Lewis structure of sodium chloride - $[Na]^+\ [|\overline{\underline{Cl}}|]^-$
## Covalent Lewis dot structure
- covalent Lewis structures include also the covalent bonds between elemnts besides their valence electrons
- ex. Lewis structure of carbon dioxide - $\overline{\underline{O}}=C=\overline{\underline{O}}$
### Calculating Lewis dot structures
1. Writing the formula of the compound and structure analysis
2. Writing every known covlent bond
3, Add electron pairs to each atom to reach the octet
4. If the number of electron pairs is not in agreement with the octet rule:
    - in the case of too many electrons, the free electron pairs are converted to bonds
    - in the case of too few electrons, add some to the central atom
# Formal charge
- **_formal charge_** is the actual charge an atom in a molecule has
    - while compounds are usually most stable in neutral states, individual atoms can be charged in the molecule
        - the overall charge of the molecule stays neutral
## Calculating formal charge
- formal charge can be calculated using a Lewis diagram
- it is calculated as follows:
$$Q_f=n_v-(n_n+\frac{1}{2}n_b)$$
- where:
    - $Q_f$ is the _formal charge_
    - $n_v$ is the _number of valence electrons_ (in a free atom)
    - $n_n$ is the _number of non-bonding electrons_
    - $n_b$ is the _number of bonding electrons_
# Resonant structures
- **_resonance structures_** are a set of at least two Lewis diagrams which collectively describe the electronic bonding in a molecule
    - this also accounts for fractional bonding
    - they can also be used to describe a system of delocalized electrons
- they are used whenever we do not know with certainty which lewis structre is correct
    - the propabilites of double bonds for example can be the same in two different cases
    - the existance of a resonant structure has been proven by meassuring the bond length of a molecule with multiple possible lewis diagrams
        - the bond lengths were quite far off the theoretical value
- ex. Resonance structure of $NO_3^-$

# Structure of molecules
- the resonant structures, Lewis diagrmas and formulae are representing a two dimensional molecule, VSEPR and the theory of hybridization helps us explain the three dimensional structure
- _bond length_ is the straight distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms
    - it is usually measured in _ånsgtröms_ or _picometers_
        - $1\ Å=10^{-10}m$
        - $1\ pm=10^{-12}m$
- _bond angle_ is the angle between any two chosen bonds which intersect with one another in one common atom
    - it is usually measured in degrees or radians
## Hybridization
- **_hybridization_** is a mathematical concept which describes the using of [atomic orbitals](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/atomic-structure-and-electron-configuration#description-of-the-quantum-model-of-an-atom) to form new _hybridized orbitals_ of the same energy
- the new orbitals have different energies nad shapes from the individual atomic orbitals
- these new orbitals are more sutable for the bonds in the molecule
- valence orbitals are most likely to hybridize
    - _d_-orbitals can also hybridize
- the number of new hybridized orbitals is equal to the number of originally involved atomic orbitals
- hybridization occurs when the participating orbitals have more or less similar energy and are suitably symmetric
- the type of hybridization depends on the atomic orbitals involved
### _sp_ hybridization
- the hybridization of one _s_-orbital and one _p_-orbital results in the creation of two hybridized _sp_-orbitals of the same energy

{{< fig class="note-fig" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FPetrGersl%2FPrk-jgEwHR.png?alt=media&token=515b7573-d865-4ba6-8a90-f352121ce14f" alt="Energies of the sp orbitals and orbitals composing them" >}}

- the shape of the _sp_-orbitals is different

{{< fig class="note-fig" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FPetrGersl%2Fn7Gl1DPEGw.png?alt=media&token=f334877f-383c-4edd-a9ef-4ffb653b17fd" alt="Shape of sp-orbitals" >}}

- _sp_ hybridization results in **linear geometrical structure**
    - it usually involves two $\sigma$ bonds
    - the bond angles around the central atom are 180°
### _sp_$^2$ hybridization
- the hybridization of one _s_-orbital and two _p_ orbitals results in the creation of three hybridized _sp_$^2$-orbitals
- _sp_$^2$ hybridization results in **trigonal planar geometrical structure**
    - it usually involves three $\sigma$ bonds
    - the bond angles around the central atom are 120°

{{< fig class="note-fig" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FPetrGersl%2FoTqcKHHJIE.png?alt=media&token=f0713a45-484a-42c7-b185-662c0a8b4c5d" alt="Energies of sp2-orbitals and orbitals composing them" cap="Energies of sp$^2$-orbitals and orbitals composing them" >}}

### _sp_$^3$ hybridization
- the hybridization of one _s_-orbital and three _p_-orbitals results in the creation of four hybridized _sp_$^3$-orbitals
- _sp_$^3$ hybridization results in **tetrahedral geometrical structure**
    - it usually involves four $\sigma$ bonds
    - the bond angles around the central atom are approximatelly 109.5°

{{< fig class="note-fig" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FPetrGersl%2Fbt1aDqskc1.png?alt=media&token=3b8d68b0-f35e-4bb8-8707-a435466f7a76" alt="Energies of sp3-orbitals and orbitals composing them" cap="Energies of sp$^3$-orbitals and orbitals composing them" >}}

## VSEPR - Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion
- some molecules do not follow the standard theory of hybridization because of their free electron pairs acting repulsing the other electrons of the bonds
- the bond angles are a little deformed as a result of the repulsion
- VSEPR predicts the shapes of molecules based on an order of repulsion
    - lone pairs occupy the least ammount of space and have the highest electron density
    - bonding pairs occupy the most ammount of space and have the lowest electron density
    - higher multiplicity bonds occupy less space than lower multiplicity bonds and have higher electron density
- _oder of repulsion_ (from strongest to weakest)
    1. lone pair - lone pair
    2. lone pair - bonding pair
    3. bonding pair - bonding pair
### Predicting the electorn pair geometry
1. Drawing the Lewis diagram
2. Identify the hybridization based on the number of $\sigma$ bonds
3. Place the lone electron pairs of the central atom accordng to the order of repulsion
