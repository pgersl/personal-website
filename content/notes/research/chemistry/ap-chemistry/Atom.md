# History of atomic models
## Ancient Greece (_Leucippus_ and _Democritus_)
- a thought of the world being composed of small indivisible particles originated at this time
- the theory was not popular and considered heretical later
- atoms were little and invisible for a naked eye and were connected together via small hooks
## Early 19th century (_John Dalton_)
- Dalton ressurected the theory of atoms
- he proposed they were small balls of different colors and sizes
- he based his thinking on many eperiments he did
## Later 19th centrury (_J. J. Thompson_)
- Thompson observed negatively charged particle rays in Crooks tubes, simillair to [Helmholtz](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/mass-spectrometry-of-elements)
- he also later observed positively charged hydrogen atoms in simillair experiments
- he named these tiny particles _corpuscules_
- he proposed a model of atom, where negatively charged particles were equally distributed in a positively charged substance (_plum-pudding model_)
- the overall charge was neutral and was equally distributed throughout the whole atom

## Late 19th century (_Ernest Rutherford_)
- Rutherford observed that when a this sheet of gold was bombared by alpha particles, they were deflected and their paths were bent
- from this he concluded that he positive part of an atom must be concentrated at one spot in the atom
- he proposed an atom with a positively charged nucleus and electrons floating around it
- later his model was refined when isotopes were discovered

## Early 20th century (_Niels Bohr_)
- Bohr refined Rutherford's model even more by adding distinctive energetic levels at which the electrons orbit
- electrons had energy at these orbits which allowed them to orbit and not simply fall to the positively charged _nucleus_
- electrons could jump from one energy level to another either emmitting or gaining energy
- the orbits of the atom constituted its _electron shell_
- this model was later refined even more, adding new ideas, e.g. more than one electron on one orbit, eliprical orbits, etc.
## Quantum model of an atom (_Erwin Schrödinger_)
- Bohr's model was found to be flawed when new observations were made
- based on calculations made by Schrödinger and his colleagues, a new model was proposed, where electrons are not orbiting atoms in distinct orbits, but rather are spinning and vibrating and some regions around the nucleus
- _orbitals_ - the regions with the highest propability of electron occurence - were proposed
# Description of the quantum model of an atom
## Quantum numbers
- electrons and their orbitals are described by four _quantum numbers_
### Principal quantum number
- **_principal quantum number_** denotes the energy level the electron is on
- it describes the overall energy of an electron
### Azimuthal quantum number
- **_azimuthal quantum number_** determines the shape of the orbital the electron is in
- it is written using a letter - _s, p, d_ and _f_
- each letter corresponds to a different shape

{{< fig class="note-fig" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FPetrGersl%2FKxj31W0Ewm.png?alt=media&token=9c35fe91-652a-4a16-9d8d-02177f650a75" alt="Shapes of orbitals and their space orientations" >}}

### Magnetic quantum number
- **_magnetic quantum number_** determines the orientation of the orbital in space
- the number of space orientatons is determined my the shape of the orbital (i.e. the azimuthal quantum number)
- _s_-orbital has **1** space orientation
- _p_-orbital has **3** space orientations
- _d_-orbital has **5** space orientations
- _f_-orbital has **7** space orientations
### Spin quantum number
- **_spin quantum number_** determines the _spin_ of an electron
- the spin is either _up_ or _down_
## Electron configuration
- **_electron configuration_** is the list of all electrons an atom has in their respective orbitals
### Filling orbitals
- how orbitals are filled is determined by three main rules:
#### Pauli's exclusion principle
> Two electrons cannot occupy the same space; therfore, they must differ at least by their spin quantum number.
#### Aufbau principle
> Electrons first occupy orbitals with the smallest ammount of energy needed.
#### Hund's rule
> The orbitals with more than one space orientation are filled first with electrons with only one spin in each of the space orientation and then with the other spin.
### Writing electron configuration
- electron configuration can be written either symbolically or graphically
- symbolical electron configuration is written as $nl^x$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number, $l$ is the azimuthal quantum number and $x$ is the number of electrons
    - the main quantum number is the row of the periodic table
    - the azimuthal quantum number is the _block_ of the periodic table

    - ex. Electron confuguration of Lithium
$$Li:\ 1s^22s^1$$
    - the notation can be shorthanded only to valence electrons using the configuration of the previous noble gas
    - ex. Shorthanded electron configuration of Sodium
$$Na:\ [Ne]3s^1$$
- graphical electron configuration is written as $nl\underline{\uparrow\ }$, where the arrows determine the spin of electrons
    - ex. Electron configuration of Oxygen
$$O:\ [He]2s\underline{\uparrow\downarrow}\ 2p\underline{\uparrow\downarrow}\ \underline{\uparrow\ }\ \underline{\uparrow\ }$$
# Periodic trends
- periodic table of elements is organized in a way that some properties of the elements can be read simply by looking on the table
## Highest energy valence orbitals
- periodic table is devided into four blocks
- see [here](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/atomic-structure-and-electron-configuration#writing-electron-configuration)
## Atomic mass
- the more nucleons an atom has, the higher its atomic mass
- **the further down and to the right we go in the periodic table, the higher the atomic mass** 
# Atomic radius
- the more protons an atom has, the bigger the pull on the electrons around it, hence a smaller atomic radius
- the atomic radius decreases in periods, since the electrons are on one energy level (in the same distance) from the nucleus
- the atomic radius increases in groups, since the outermost electrons are further from the nucleus, because they are on a higher energy level
- **the further down and to the left we go in the periodic table, the higher the atomic radius**
## Ionic radius
- the ionic radius shrinks when electrons are removed and it grows when they are added for the same reasons atomic radius behaves the way it does
- the ionic radius is going to be larger the bigger the difference between the number of electrons and the number of protons gets
## First ionization energy
- **_first ionization energy_** is the energy needed to remove one (the outermost) electron of an atom

- atoms are most stable when their valence orbitals are either full or half-full
    - noble gasses have the highest first ionization energies, because they have their valence orbitals full and thus don't want to give them up
    - alkali metals are only one electron away from reaching a full orbital one energy level lower and thus are glad to give the one electron up
    - elements like nitrogen have their valence _p_-orbital half-full and thus halfway to having a full _p_-orbital or a full _s_-orbital, which means they are rather stable and wont give up their electrons as easily as elements like oxygen or fluorine
- **the further up and to the right we go in the periodic table, the higher the first ionization energy**
## Electronegativity $\varkappa$
- **_electronegativity_** is the tendency of an atom tu pull electrons of a chemical bond towards itself
- it is related to first ionization energy and _electron affinity_
    - _electron affinity_ is the tendency of an atom to keep its electrons in its electron shell
- electronegativty can be calculated as:
$$\varkappa=\cfrac{E_I+E_{EA}}{2}$$
- where:
    - $E_I$ is the _first ionization energy_
    - $E_{EA}$ is the _electron affinity_
- **the further up and to the right we go in the periodic table, the higher the electronegativity**
