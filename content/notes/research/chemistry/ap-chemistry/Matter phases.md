# Solids
- they retain their volume and are incompressible
    - when strong enough force is applied to them, they undergo deformation
- their particles are rather close to one another and act on themselves via rather strong interactions
## Amorphous solids
- they don't have a crysalline latice
- the particles can move around rather freely, but not as freely as to allow free flow
- they are malleble but also fragile
- melting point cannot be easily measured, since the increase in flow is constant
### Glass
- glass is a specific form of amorphous solids
- it is mostly amorphous but also contains parts of crystalline strcutred molecules
## Crystalline solids
- they have a crystalline latice
- the particles are clearly ordered
- they tend to be rather strong but brittle
### Quasicrystalline solids
- these solids seem to have some repeating patterns in their structure, but no in the entire solid
- they commonly have fractal paterns
## Molecular solids
- they are made of molecules interacting together only via intermolecular forces
- they are very soft and have low melting points
- they can be either amorphous or crystalline 
## Covalent solids
- the individual particles are held together via covalent bonds
- they are very hard, have high melting points
- they are generally bad conductors
    - it can be changed by introducing an impurity
- they can be either amorphous or crystalline
- all of these solids can be combined together
# Liquids
- the froces between the particles are still rather strong, but they do not prevent spontanious flow
- they are incompressable and don't expand spontaniously
- particles can flow through the whole volume of the substance rather freely, hence phenomena like diffusion are rather easy to see by naked eye
# Gasses
- the forces between the particles are very small to non-existant
- they do not have a fixed volume and are easily compressable
- the movement of particles is practically free, hence phenomena like diffusion are extremely fast
# Properties of fluids
- _fluids_ is the collective name for substances which are able to flow, liquids and gasses
- **_density_** $\rho$ describes the mass of a certain volume

$$\rho=\cfrac{m}{V}$$

- **_viscosity_** describes the inability of a material to flow
- **_surface tension_** is the tendency of surfaces to assume the minimum possible area
    - the particles of the material close to the surface do not experience any force per se, but rather are a result of all the forces in the material together
    - the molecules around a liquid have different energies and affect the shape of the surface
        - the resulting shape can be ither flat, concave ($\cup$) or convex ($\cap$)
        - the energy of the whole system is minimal and close to zero still
    - in some cases the liquid flows up or down as the result of it being either attracted to or repulsed from the surface of a container
        - this phenomenon is called _capillary acition_ (either _elevation_ or _depression_) and it forms either a concave or a convex _meniscus_
