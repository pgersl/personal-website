# Elementary reactions
- **_elementry reactions_** are reactions which do not have an intermediate step
- **_intermediate_** is a species which is neither a reactant nor a product
    - it is usually quite unstable, although, in some cases, it can be isolated
- these reactions can be represented by simple notation, yet their mechanism is very complex
- their stoichiometric coefficients correspond with their [order](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/kinetics/reaction-rates#order-of-a-reaction)
    - this is not the case for non-elementary reactions
# Movement of particles resulting in a reaction
- paticles react with one another by collidng - _collision model_
- in _monomolecular reactions_ (where one particle undergoes a chemical change), nothing collides
- in _bimolecular reactions_ (where two different particles interact), a collision happens
    - whether a collision results in a reaction is determined by the space orientation of the particles
    - the reaction also needs to overcome an energy barrier - _activation energy_
- in reactions with more than two different particles, a succession of elementary reaction happens before the final product is formed
- collision which do result in a chemical reaction are called _effecive_ (otherwise, they are _ineffective_)
