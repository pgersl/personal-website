- **_activation energy_** $E_a$ is the energy needed to start a chemical reaction
# Reaction coordinate
- graphing the total energy levels of a reaction results in a _reaction energy profile_ (_reaction coordinate_)
## Elementary reaction coordinate

{{< fig class="note-fig" src="/images/figs/reaction-energy-profile/1.png" alt="Elementary reaction energy profile" >}}

- on it, three stages are distinguishable:
    - **R** - energy of the reactants
    - **TS** - energy of the transition state
    - **P** - energy of the products
- the difference between the energy of the products and the transition state is the activation energy
## Multi-step reaction coordinate

# Transition state
- transition state is a state, where the reactans for an _activated complex_
- it is an intermediate which exists for a very short ammount of time and cannot be measured very well
# Calculation of the rate constant using the activation energy
- the [rate constant](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/kinetics/reaction-rates#method-2) can be calculated by the _Arrhenius equation_

$$k=Ae^{\frac{-E_a}{RT}}$$

- where:
    - $A$ is _the pre-exponential factor_
        - it is uniqe for every reaction
        - it needs to be determined experimentally
    - $R$ is _the [universal gas constant](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/intermolecular-forces-and-properties/the-ideal-gas-law#ideal-gas-law)_
    - $T$ is _the absolute temperature_
- a newer equation was developed, which does not use any experimentl values - _[Eyrling equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyring_equation)_
    - it is more useful in the theoretical field
## Implications of the Arrhenius equation
1. The higher the activation energy, the lower the rate constant and the lower the rate of the reaciton.
2. The higher the temperature, the faster the reaction.
