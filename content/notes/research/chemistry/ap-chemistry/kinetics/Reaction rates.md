- **_reaction rate_** $v$ desribes the speed of a reaction
- unit: $mol\cdot{dm^{-3}}\cdot{s^{-1}}$
# Calculation
$$v=\cfrac{\Delta{c}}{\Delta{t}}$$
- where:
    - $\Delta{c}$ is _the change in concentration_
    - $\Delta{t}$ is _the change in time_
- for a general reaction, the equation is more complex, since it includes all the possible reactants and products
$$v=-\sum{\cfrac{\Delta{c_R}}{\nu_R\cdot\Delta{t}}}=\sum{\cfrac{\Delta{c_P}}{\nu_P\cdot\Delta{t}}}$$
- where:
    - $\Delta{c_R}$ is _the change in concentration of a reactant_
    - $\Delta{c_P}$ is _the change in concentration of a product_
    - $\Delta{t}$ is _the change in time_
    - $\nu_R$ is _the stoichiometric coefficient of a reactant_
    - $\nu_P$ is _the stoichiometric coefficient of a product_
# The change in concentration over time
- as the concentration of the product increases, the concentration of the reactant decreases as the time goes on
