- **_catalyst_** is a substance which bonds with the molecules of the reactant (either via [covalent bonds](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/molecular-and-ionic-compound-structure-and-properties/types-of-chemical-bonds#covalent-bonds) or [intermolecular forces](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/intermolecular-forces-and-properties/intermolecular-forces-and-properties)) to form an intermediate which requires less activation energy than the activation energy of the reaction without it
- catalyst forms an intermediate which then breaks down to the product and the catalyst or is kicked out by another substance
- catalyst itself does not undergo any reaction and is regenerated in the end
- catalysis needs to be taken into account when calculating the overall rate of the reaction
- the reaction profile changes

- catalysis is important in most natural processes and is enabled primarily by enzymes
    - it is also used in countelss synthesis processes
