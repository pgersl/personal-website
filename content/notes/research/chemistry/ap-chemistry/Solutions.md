- **_solvation_** is the process of decomposition of a molecule due to its intermolecular interactions with other molecules
- **_solvent_** is any substance capable of _solvation_
- **_solute_** is any substance undergoing solvation
- **_solution_** is the mixture created by dissolving a solute in a solvent
# Molecule movement in a solution
- molecules in a solution orient themselves so that the charged particles (or dipoles) attract one another
- _polar solvents_ dissolve polar molecules
    - the molecules of solvent attack the molecules of solute and rip them appart forming micelle-like structures around the ions of the compound
# Describing mixtures
## Mass percent/fraction $w$
- it is the ratio of the mass of the solute to the mass of the solution

$$w=\cfrac{m_i}{m}$$

## Molarity $c$
- _molarity_ represents the number of moles of the solute in a volume of the solution
- it can be used to describe solutions which are hard to weigh
- it is prefered in most cases
- the base unit is $mol\cdot{dm^{-3}}$
    - it is usually written as just $M$

$$c=\cfrac{n_i}{V}$$

## Molality $b$
- _molality_ is the reation of the number of moles of the solute to the mass of the solvent
- it is widely used in biochemistry
- the base unit is $mol\cdot{kg^{-1}}$
    - is is usually written as just $m$

$$b=\cfrac{n_i}{m_s}$$

## Concentrating/Diluting a solution
- mass percent equilibrium

$$m_{i1}=m_{i2}$$
$$w_1m_1=w_2m_2$$

- molarity/molality equilibrium

$$n_{i1}=n_{i2}$$
$$c_1V_1=c_2V_2$$
$$b_1m_{s1}=b_2m_{s2}$$

# Dissociation and reaction schemes
- _dissociation_ is a chemical reaction in which a molecule is broken up into its individual parts
- chemical reactions can be represented in _rection schemes_
    - rection scheme of a dissolution in water: $AB(s)\overset{H_2O}{\longrightarrow}Na^+(aq)+Cl^-(aq)$
    - the state of the compounds can be represented using letters in brackets behind the formula
        - $(s)$ - solid
        - $(l)$ - liquid
        - $(g)$ - gas
        - $(aq)$ - aqeous solution
    - the substance that causes the reaction to happen (_reactant_) is often placed **above** the arrow
    - the substance that is produced during the reaction but is unimportant for further continuation of the reaction is often placed **under** the arrow
- when no more substance can be disolved, we call it the _point of saturation_
# Electrolytes
- _electrolyte_ is a substance the solution in a polar solvent of which conducts electricity
    - oposite is _nonelectrolyte_
    - _strong electrolyte_ dissolves fully and easily in a polar solvent
        - an example is sodium chloride $NaCl$
        - they are formed by strong acids and strong bases
        - dissolution of sodium chloride in water:        
            $$NaCl(s)\overset{H_2O}{\longrightarrow}Na^+(aq)+Cl^-(aq)$$
    - _weak electrolyte_ doesn't dissolve properly or in its entirety in a polar solvent
        - an example is sodium fluoride $NaF$
        - they are formed by weak acid and strong base, strong acid and weak base or weak acid and weak base
        - they alter the pH of the solution
        - dissolution of sodium fluoride in water
            $$NaF(s)\overset{H_2O}{\longrightarrow}Na^+(aq)+HF(aq)+OH^-(aq)$$
# Effects on solubility
- the amount of disolved salts rises with the rising temperature
    - the increasing temeprature weakens the bonds in the solute, thus making it more susceptable to dissolution
    - higher speeds of molecules of the solvent make it easier to break up crystal lattices
- the amount of disolved gas decreases with the rising temperature
    - the higher speed of the molecules of the solute make it easier to break from the attractive forces of the solvent
# Separation methods
## Evaporation
- a solution is heated up and the solvent is boiled of leaving the solute in a crystallizzed form
- should there be more solutes, the result will be the mix of them
- should the solute be thermically unstable, evaporation should not be used
- it is usually done under low pressure to lower the boiling point of the solvent

## Crystallization
- a solvent is heated up and the solute is then added to the point of saturation; the mixture is left to cool and is left to cool down
- it is primarily used as a purification step
    - products can be very pure
- it is primarily used in organic chemistry to purify water soluble substances

## Filtration
- a solution is passed through a porous barrier (_filter_) which removes any hard solids from a solution
- it is primarily used as a purification step, but can also be used as a separation technique
- _permeate_ (_filtrate_) is the substances which goes through the filter (usually the goal)
- _retenate_ (_residue_) is the substance which stays on the filter (usually the waste)

# Chromatography
- it is a method of analysing a solution
- an _absorber solid_ (_stationary phase_) with a sample (a drop of ink for example) is sunk into a solution (_mobile phase_)
- the solution will rise up due to the capillary action and the individual constituents will slow down based on their polarity
- the drop of ink will spread and show many colors as the different constituents stop at different places of the stationary phase

## Distillation
- a solution is heated; as the liquids with different boiling points boil, they are liquified again in a condenser and seperated into a different conatiner
- if there are more liquids to be seperated, we call them _fractions_
    - the process is then called _fractional distillation_
        - it is primarily used in petrochemistry and making alcohol
- the vapor is liquified by cooling it down using cold water in most cases
