- **_chemical bonds_** are lasting attractions between two atoms
- chemical bonds can be established between two atoms which do not have their valnce electron shell completely filled
    - _noble gasses_ (helium, neon and argon primarily) are thus very unreactive and form only a very small number of compounds
- chemical bonds form in three differnet ways:
    1. **electron sharing** - _covalent bonds_
    2. **elecrostatic attraction** - _ionic bonds_
    3. **electron transfer** - _donor-acceptor bonds_
    - in all of these cases, the atoms which constitute the bond are as close as possible to the most stable electron configuration of the noble gases
- bonds can be devided into two categories by force:
    - **strong/primary** - the bonds mentioned above and in detail explained below
    - **weak/secondary** - [intermolecular forces](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/molecular-and-ionic-compound-sructure-and-properties/intermolecular-forces-and-properties)
# Covalent bonds
- **_covalent bonds_** are created between atoms when it is most stable fo them to share electrons
- one, two, three or more _electron pairs_ (one electron belonging to each bonding partner) can be shared to form single, double, triple or higher-multiplicity bonds respectively
    - the attraction between is stronger with more electron pairs shared
    - single, double and triple bonds are the most common in the nature
        - higher-multiplicity bonds occure only between lanthanides and actinides
- the bond is formed via an overlap or a strong attraction of orbitals of the bonding partners
## $\sigma$ bonds
- $\sigma$ bodning occurs when orbitals overlap

- the orbitals overlap along the internuclear axis (nulceus-nucleus)
- electron density between the two bonding partners is symmetric
- they are the strongest bond between two atoms
## $\pi$ bonds
- $\pi$ bonding occurs when orbital overlap on a parallel to the internuclear axis or when they are strongy attracted towards one another
- the electron density is highest above and below the plane of the intermolecular axis
- $\pi$ bonds are formed in double, triple and higher-multiplicity bonds, the single bond is always a $\sigma$ bond
## The role of electronegativity
- electronegativity plays a part to the covalent bond as well
- the result of bonding of two atoms of different negativites is that the more electronegative bartner attracts the shared electrons more than the more electropositive bonding partner
- this means that some parts of the molecule are _partially charged_
### Partial charge
- **_partial charge_** - $\delta$ - can be either positive - $\delta^+$ - or negative - $\delta^-$
    - the bonding partner with higher electronegativity will have a negative partial charge
    - the bonding partner with lower electronegativity will have a positive partial charge
- molecules with significant differences of partial charges are called _polar_
- molecules with insignificant or no partial charges are called _non-polar_
- if partial charges exist, the bonding partners form an _electric dipole_
    - this plays a massive role in the intermolcular forces between different electric dipoles and it influences the properties of the molecule
- in one molecule, there can be more electric dipoles influencind one another
    - the polarity of a molecule depends on where the electric dipoles are and the molecule's geometry
    - if the the strenghts of the dipoles is equal and the dipoles are directly oposite to one another, the molecule is overall non-polar
### Differences of electronegativites
- the difference in electronegativities of the bonding partners determines how polar the bond is
    - if the difference is low, the bond is less polar
        - this is when the difference is less than 0.4
    - if the difference is rather high, the bond is more polar
        - this is when the difference is in a range from 0.4 to 1.7
    - if the differnece is really high, the bond is probably not longer covalent but ionic
        - this is when the difference is higher than 1.7
# Ionic bonds
**_ionic bonds_** are created between atoms when it is most stable for them to give up electrons
- typically, ionic bonds are formed between metals and non-metals
- electrons of the bond partners are transfered
    - the transfer leads to creation of two oppositely charged particles
    - one partner loses one or more valence electrons and a _cation_ is formed
    - on partner gains one or more valence electrons and a _anion_ is formed
- the electron configurations of the bodning partners reach as close as possible to the electron configuration of noble gases
    - the _octet rule_ states that an atom is most stable when all of its valence orbitals are filled (with eight electrons exactly)
    - the _duet rule_ states that it is more stable for an atom to have to atoms in its valnce shell rather that more or less
- hence, there are two conditions for an ionic compound to be formed:
    1. **_The stability rule_** - the atom must adhere to the octet or duet rule
    2. **_The neutrality rule_** - the created ionic compound must be neutral and the charges of the ions forming the bond must be balenced out
