# Formal charge
- **_formal charge_** is the actual charge an atom in a molecule has
    - while compounds are usually most stable in neutral states, individual atoms can be charged in the molecule
        - the overall charge of the molecule stays neutral
## Calculating formal charge
- formal charge can be calculated using a Lewis diagram
- it is calculated as follows:
$$Q_f=n_v-(n_n+\frac{1}{2}n_b)$$
- where:
    - $Q_f$ is the _formal charge_
    - $n_v$ is the _number of valence electrons_ (in a free atom)
    - $n_n$ is the _number of non-bonding electrons_
    - $n_b$ is the _number of bonding electrons_
# Resonant structures
- **_resonance structures_** are a set of at least two [Lewis diagrams](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/molecular-and-ionic-compound-structure-and-properties/lewis-diagrams) which collectively describe the electronic bonding in a molecule
    - this also accounts for fractional bonding
    - they can also be used to describe a system of delocalized electrons
- they are used whenever we do not know with certainty which lewis structre is correct
    - the propabilites of double bonds for example can be the same in two different cases
    - the existance of a resonant structure has been proven by meassuring the bond length of a molecule with multiple possible lewis diagrams
        - the bond lengths were quite far off the theoretical value
- ex. Resonance structure of $NO_3^-$
