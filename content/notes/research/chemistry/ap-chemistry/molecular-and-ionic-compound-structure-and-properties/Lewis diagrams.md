- _Lewis strctures_ (_Lewis diagrams_ or _Lewis electron dot diagrams_) enable us to write the role of every valence electron in a chemical bond
# Lewis symbols
- electrons are represented as dots on the sides of the symbol of an element
    - electron pairs are represented as a double dot or more commonly with a line
    - typically, it does not matter on which side the unpaired electrons end up, but if there are more than one, the should be on the oposite side
    - only valence electrons are included (the orbitals in which they are do not matter)
- ex. Lewis diagram of an oxygen atom - $\cdot\underline{\overline{O}}\cdot$
- the dots can be used to ilustrate ionistion reactions more easily
    - ex. Lithium loosing its electron - $Li\cdot\longrightarrow{Li^++e^-}$
# Octet rule
- it is most stable for elements to have eight valence electrons in their valence shell
    - exceptions are the atoms closer to Helium, where it is most stable for them to have only two electrons in their valence shell (_duet rule_)
- atoms achive this usually via bonding
    - the shared electrons count to the number of electrons in both participants' valence shells
- these stable atoms can be written using the Lewis diagrams as $|\underline{\overline{X}}|$
## Exceptions
- _molecules with odd numbers of electrons_
    - sometimes, it is natural for radicals (substances with one or more unpaired electrons) to occur naturally
    - no multiplicity of the bond enables them to have the electron octet
    - ex. $NO$ - $\cdot\overline{N}\equiv{O|}$
- _over-filled octets_
    - sometimes, central atoms have more than eight electrons in their valence shell after bonding
    - this occurs with elements that can create complex compounds  with other types of bonds
- _under-filled octets_
    - sometimes, the central atom's most stable arrengements are more simple and with less valence electrons than the octet rule suggests
    - in these compound, new interesting types of bonding occure
# Ionic Lewis dot structures
- Lewis structures of ionic compounds can clearly show where electrons were transfered in a compound
- the ions are usually written in a square parathesis [] with their charges written
- ex. Lewis structure of sodium chloride - $[Na]^+\ [|\overline{\underline{Cl}}|]^-$
# Covalent Lewis dot structure
- covalent Lewis structures include also the covalent bonds between elemnts besides their valence electrons
- ex. Lewis structure of carbon dioxide - $\overline{\underline{O}}=C=\overline{\underline{O}}$
## Calculating Lewis dot structures
1. Writing the formula of the compound and structure analysis
2. Writing every known covlent bond
3, Add electron pairs to each atom to reach the octet
4. If the number of electron pairs is not in agreement with the octet rule:
    - in the case of too many electrons, the free electron pairs are converted to bonds
    - in the case of too few electrons, add some to the central atom
