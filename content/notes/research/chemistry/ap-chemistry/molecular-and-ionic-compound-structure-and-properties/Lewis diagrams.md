- _Lewis strctures_ (_Lewis diagrams_ or _Lewis electron dot diagrams_) enable us to write the role of every valence electron in a chemical bond
# Lewis symbols
- electrons are represented as dots on the sides of the symbol of an element
    - electron pairs are represented as a double dot or more commonly with a line
    - typically, it does not matter on which side the unpaired electrons end up, but if there are more than one, the should be on the oposite side
    - only valence electrons are included (the orbitals in which they are do not matter)
- ex. Lewis diagram of an oxygen atom - $\cdot\underline{\overline{O}}\cdot$
- the dots can be used to ilustrate ionistion reactions more easily
    - ex. Lithium loosing its electron - $Li\cdot\longrightarrow{Li^++e^-}$
# Octet rule
- it is most stable for elements to have eight valence electrons in their valence shell
    - exceptions are the atoms closer to Helium, where it is most stable for them to have only two electrons in their valence shell (_duet rule_)
- atoms achive this usually via bonding
    - the shared electrons count to the number of electrons in both participants' valence shells
- these stable atoms can be written using the Lewis diagrams as $|\underline{\overline{X}}|$
