# Crystaline structure
- the anions and cations of the ionic compound together create a lartger three-dimensional structure - **_crystaline structure_**
- the structure is highly regular and forms an _ordinal latice_
- one ionic compound can have more than one crystline structure
## Lattice energy
- the ions together in this crystaline structre are minimazing the _lattice energy_
- it is the energy of the repulsion and attraction between individual ions
    - the attractive forces are at maximum whilst the repulsive forces are at minimum
- it influences many properties of the compound - solubility, hardness, volatility
    - ionic compounds are usually very hard but brittle
    - they also have very high melting points
- the smaller atomic radii and higher the charge, the higher the lattice energy
- the higher the melting point of an ionic solid, the higher the lattice energy
## Valence shells
- electrons in the valence shells are _localized_ (unlike in [metalic bonds](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/molecular-and-ionic-compound-structure-and-properties/intramolecular-force-and-potential-energy#metalic-bond))
- ionic compounds show very low electric and heat conductivity
- when ionic compounds are heated, the valence shells don't start to overlap, but the conductivity is still higher, because the ions themselves are able to carry the charge
# Coulumb's law
- the interaction between ions in a crystalline lattice can be described using the Coulumb's law
- the interaction strength can be approximated using:

$$E=k\cfrac{Q_1Q_2}{d}$$

- where:
    - $E$ is the _interaction strength_
    - $k$ is the _Coulumb's constant_ ($=8.99\cdot{10^{-9}}\ Nm^2C^{-2}$)
    - $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the _charges of the particles_
    - $d$ is the _distance between atomic nuclei_
- the overall energy of the interactions is equal to the sum of the energies between all atoms and their combinations in the lattice
    - for $NaCl$ that is:

$$ E=E_{Na^+Cl^-}+E_{Na^+Na^+}+E_{Cl^-Cl^-}=\cfrac{-k}{d_{Na^+Cl^-}}+\cfrac{k}{d_{Na^+Na^+}}+\cfrac{k}{d_{Cl^-Cl^-}}$$
