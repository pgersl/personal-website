# Pure metals
- metals usually have a much higher number of electrons in the highest enrgy orbitals due to the electrons in _d_-orbitals and in _f_-orbitals
- electrons are _delocalized_ in metals and can flow almost freely through the whole lattice
- metalic bond explains many characteristics of metals
    - _ductility, melleability_
        - the individual layers of the metalic lattice and theit delocalized electrons are able to easily slide when external force is applied
    - _heat conductivity, electric conductivity_
        - the free movement of electrons enables very easy transfer of charge, thus the trasnfer of heat and electricity
    - _high melting and boiling points_
        - the attraction of the ions and electrons together is very strong
# Alloys
- **_alloys_** are mixtures (or combinations) of two or more metals
    - they sometimes have other elements added as well
- the metal that composes the majority of the alloy is called the _base_
- the metal that is added to the base metal is called the _dopant_
- these combinations of different elements change the properties of pure elements
    - the properties of the alloy can be changed by adjusting its composition
    - the properties resulting from alloying include strength, hardness, durability and resistence to corrosion
## Substitutional alloys
- **_substitutional alloys_** are those alloys, where the atoms of the dopant are very similar in size to the atoms of the base metal
- the atoms of the dopant simply substitute the atoms of metal in the lattice
- the final structure can be very similar to that of a pure metal
- examples: _bronze,  brass_
## Interstitial alloys
- **_interstitial alloys_** are those alloys, where atoms of the dopant are rather different in size to the atoms of the base metal
- the dopant's atoms are usually smaller
- the atoms of the dopant fill out the empty spaces (_intersices_) between the metalic cation of the crystaline latice
- the positions of the atoms of the dopant strongly influence the alloy's properties
