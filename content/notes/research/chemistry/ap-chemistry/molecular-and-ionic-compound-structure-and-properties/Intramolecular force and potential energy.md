- **_intramolecular force_** is an attraction or any force in general that is formed between two atoms within a molecule
    - intramolecular forces include [covalent and ionic bonds](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/molecular-and-ionic-compound-structure-and-properties/types-of-chemical-bonds)
# Bond length and energy
- **_bond length_** is the distance of the two nuclei of the bonding partners
    - it is usually meassured in _ångströms_ ($1Å=10^{-10}m$)
- **_bond energy_** is measures the bond's strength and how much energy is needed to destroy it
## Bond formation
- as the bonding partners are moving closer together, the potntial energy of the system changes
- when the atoms are distant, the attraction is practically non-existent
- with distance, the energy of the system decreases and thus the system becomes much more stable
- at a point when the attractve force is the same as the rpulsive force of the two atoms, the energy of the system reaches the smallest point and a bond is formed
    - the bond length is determined here also
- energy needed to seperate the atoms can be seen
- if the atoms were moved even closer together, the enrgy of the system increases rapidally

- the energy needed to dissociate the bond partners increases as the bond length gets shorter
    - triple bonds will thus be much stronger than single bonds
    - energy of the bonds with larger atomic readii will be smaller
- bonds get stronger in this order: metalic - non-polar covalent - polar covalent - ionic
# Metalic bond
- **_metalic bond_** is a special type of bond
- it is created in polymeraic structures of metal crystals
- the orbitals of these metals overlap a lot and all the electrons of these overlapping orbitals are shared in the whole crystal creating the _electron gas_
