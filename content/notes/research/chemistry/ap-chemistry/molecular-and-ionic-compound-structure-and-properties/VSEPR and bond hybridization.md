- the [resonant structures](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/molecular-and-ionic-compound-structure-and-properties/resonance-and-formal-charge), [Lewis diagrmas](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/molecular-and-ionic-compound-structure-and-properties/lewis-diagrams) and [formulae](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/elemental-composition-of-pure-substances#denoting-pure-substances) are representing a two dimensional molecule, VSEPR and the theory of hybridization helps us explain the three dimensional structure
- _bond length_ is the straight distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms
    - it is usually measured in _ånsgtröms_ or _picometers_
        - $1\ Å=10^{-10}m$
        - $1\ pm=10^{-12}m$
- _bond angle_ is the angle between any two chosen bonds which intersect with one another in one common atom
    - it is usually measured in degrees or radians
# Hybridization
- **_hybridization_** is a mathematical concept which describes the using of [atomic orbitals](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/atomic-structure-and-electron-configuration#description-of-the-quantum-model-of-an-atom) to form new _hybridized orbitals_ of the same energy
- the new orbitals have different energies nad shapes from the individual atomic orbitals
- these new orbitals are more sutable for the bonds in the molecule
- valence orbitals are most likely to hybridize
    - _d_-orbitals can also hybridize
- the number of new hybridized orbitals is equal to the number of originally involved atomic orbitals
- hybridization occurs when the participating orbitals have more or less similar energy and are suitably symmetric
- the type of hybridization depends on the atomic orbitals involved
## _sp_ hybridization
- the hybridization of one _s_-orbital and one _p_-orbital results in the creation of two hybridized _sp_-orbitals of the same energy

- the shape of the _sp_-orbitals is different

- _sp_ hybridization results in **linear geometrical structure**
    - it usually involves two $\sigma$ bonds
    - the bond angles around the central atom are 180°
## _sp_$^2$ hybridization
- the hybridization of one _s_-orbital and two _p_ orbitals results in the creation of three hybridized _sp_$^2$-orbitals
- _sp_$^2$ hybridization results in **trigonal planar geometrical structure**
    - it usually involves three $\sigma$ bonds
    - the bond angles around the central atom are 120°

## _sp_$^3$ hybridization
- the hybridization of one _s_-orbital and three _p_-orbitals results in the creation of four hybridized _sp_$^3$-orbitals
- _sp_$^3$ hybridization results in **tetrahedral geometrical structure**
    - it usually involves four $\sigma$ bonds
    - the bond angles around the central atom are approximatelly 109.5°

# VSEPR - Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion
- some molecules do not follow the standard theory of hybridization because of their free electron pairs acting repulsing the other electrons of the bonds
- the bond angles are a little deformed as a result of the repulsion
- VSEPR predicts the shapes of molecules based on an order of repulsion
    - lone pairs occupy the least ammount of space and have the highest electron density
    - bonding pairs occupy the most ammount of space and have the lowest electron density
    - higher multiplicity bonds occupy less space than lower multiplicity bonds and have higher electron density
- _oder of repulsion_ (from strongest to weakest)
    1. lone pair - lone pair
    2. lone pair - bonding pair
    3. bonding pair - bonding pair
## Predicting the electorn pair geometry
1. Drawing the Lewis diagram
2. Identify the hybridization based on the number of $\sigma$ bonds
3. Place the lone electron pairs of the central atom accordng to the order of repulsion
