# Introduction
- **_chemical reactions_** are the processes in which chemical composition changes
    - the changes can be either:
        - physical - evaporation, sublimation, condensation
            - atomic composition stays the same
        - chemical - breaking bonds and creating new ones
            - atomic composition changes
- **_chemical equation_** is a way to represent a chemical reactions based on the lowest mathematical molar ratios of the different substances that react together
    - on both sides of a chemical equation:
        - the charge is **conserved** (_[law of conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy)_)
        - the mass is **conserved** (_[law of conservation of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_mass)_)
- **_reaction scheme_** is an unbalanced chemical equation (mass nor charge is conserved)
    - the scheme is balanced using _stoichiometrich coefficients_
- **_reactants_** are the substances that _come into_ a chemical reaction
    - they are written on the left side of a chemical equation
- **_products_** are the substances that _come out of_ a chemical reactions as the result of all the processes of the chemical reaction
    - they are written on the right side of a chemical equation
- **_stoichiometry_** is the collections of different calculations that can be performed with a balanced chemical equation
    - the calculations are based on different laws ([ideal gas law](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/intermolecular-forces-and-properties/the-ideal-gas-law), _vide ultra_)
- **_limiting reagent_** is the reactant that is in scarcity
- **_excess reagent_** is the reactant that is in abundance (= is left unreacted due to a pressence of the limiting reagent)
# Net ionic equations
- **_ionic equations_** help us understand what exactly happens in an aqeous [solution](/notes/research/chemistry/ap-chemistry/intermolecular-forces-and-properties/mixtures-and-solutions)
- they take into account every dissociation and formation
- it also helps us identify _spectator ions_ (ions, which do not interfere with the reactions in any significant way)
- when a newly formed substance is insoluble, it is called the _precipitate_ (verb _to precipitate_)
- example:
    - **reaction scheme**: $AlCl_3\ (aq)+NaOH\ (aq)\longrightarrow NaCl\ (aq)+Al(OH)_3\ (s)$
    - **chemical equation**: $AlCl_3\ (aq)+3\ NaOH\ (aq)\longrightarrow 3\ NaCl\ (aq)+Al(OH)_3\ (s)$
    - **net ionic equation**: $Al^{3+}+3\ Cl^-+3\ Na^++3\ OH^-\longrightarrow 3\ Na^++3\ Cl^-+Al(OH)_3\ (s)$
    - **solute**: $NaCl$
        - **spectator ions**: $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$
    - **precipitate**: $Al(OH)_3$
# Types of chemical reactions
- **_synthesis_** (_combination reaction_) is a reaction where two or more substances react to form a single new substance
$$A+B\longrightarrow AB$$
- **_analysis_** (_decomposition reaction_) is a reaction where one substance breaks up into two or more new substances
$$AB\longrightarrow A+B$$
- **_substitution_** (_single-replacement reaction_) is a reaction where a part of a molecule is replaced by a new substance
$$AB+C\longrightarrow AC+B$$
- **_double-replacement reaction_** is a reaction where parts of two molecules switch forming two new substances
$$AB+CD\longrightarrow AC+BD$$
- **_homogeneous reaction_** is a reaction where all the reactants are the same phase
- **_heterogeneous reaction_** is a reaction where all the reactants are not the same phase
## Redox reactions
- **_oxidation-reduction reaction_** is a reaction where one atom undergoes _oxidation_ and another undergoes _reduction_
- _oxidation_ is the process of increasing an atom's oxidation state (_i.e. the charge it would have if it was ripped out of the molecule it is in_)
    - this is caused by _ridding of_ electrons
    - a substance (or atom) that is capable of oxidizing other substances is called the _reducing agent_
- _reduction_ is the process of decreaseing an atom's oxidation state
    - this is caused by _accepting_ electrons
    - a substance that is capable of reducing other substances is called the _oxidizing agent_
- examples of such reactions are: the formation of glucose and release of oxygen in plants (carbon reduces, oxygen oxidizes), corrosion of metals (metal oxidizes, oxygen reduces), neutralization of hypermangan ($2\ KMnO_4+16\ HCl\longrightarrow 5\ Cl_2+2\ MnCl_2+2\ KCl+8\ H_2O$)
- the balance of the change of oxidation states must be conserved
- balancing redox equaions is more complicated than the balancing of simple equation where no substance undergoes oxidation or reduction
    1. the oxidizing and reducing agents are identified
    2. the total change in oxidation states is noted and switched between the agents (if the two numbers are divisible by one another, the division is made)
    3. the numbers from the second step are written as stoichiometric coefficients to the reaction to the corresponding substances which undergo the oxidation or reduction
    4. the two sides of the reaction scheme are then checked and the conservation of mass is controlled, if any inequiality is found, the stoichiometric coefficient are adjusted
- **_disproportionation_** is a reaction, where one atom undergoes both oxidation and reduction, thus appearing in two different molecules of the product mixture in two different oxidation states
- **_comproportionation_** is a reaction, where one atom in two different molecules of the reactant mixture undergoes both oxidation and reduction appearing in only one molecule in the product mixture in one new oxidation state
