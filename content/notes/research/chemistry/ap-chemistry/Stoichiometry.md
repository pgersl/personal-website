# Moles and molar masses
## Avogadro constant $N_A$
- _Avogadro constant_ specifies the ammount of particles in a mole of any substance

$$1\ N_A=6.022\cdot{10^{23}}\ mol^{-1}$$

- it is defined as the number of atoms in precisely 12 grams of $^{12}C$ isotope
## Mole of a substance $mol$
- a _mole_ is precisely the Avogadro contant number of particles
- with the weight of an atom, the wieght of a mole increases
- the number of moles of a substance is called _ammount of substance_ $n$
## Molar mass $M$
- **_molar mass_** is the weight of one mole of a substance
- molar mass of an atom is derived from the relative atomic weight (which can be found in the periodic table)
    - _relative atomic weight_ $m_a$ has specifies the weight of a mole of a substance composed only of single atoms
    - molar mass specifies the weight of a mole of a substance composed of either single atoms or molecules
- molar mass of a molecule is the sum of relative atomic weights of its individual atoms

$$M=\sum{m_a}$$

## Relationships
- calculating the mass of a substance

$$m=n\cdot{M}$$

- thus:

$$n=\cfrac{m}{M}\ \ \ M=\cfrac{m}{n}$$

- calculating the number of particles $N$ of a substance

$$N=n\cdot{N_A}$$

- thus:

$$n=\cfrac{N}{N_A}\ \ \ N_A=\cfrac{N}{n}$$

# Elemental composition of pure substances
## Denoting elements
- writing down the composition of paticles combines using letters (the symbols of elements) and numbers
- numbers are written in four indexes around the symbol of the element
    - top right index denotes the _overall charge_ of the prticle
    - bottom right index denotes the _number of atoms_ constituting the particle
    - bottom left index denotes the _number of protons_
    - to left index denotes the _overall number of nucleons_
        - it is also reffered to as the _mass number_
- ex. $_8^{18}O_2^{-1}$ - _dioxygen-18 (-1) anion_
## Denoting pure substances
### Structural formula
- **_structural formulae_** denote every atom and bond of the substance
    - some formulae also add free electron pairs
- ex.

{{< fig class="note-fig" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FPetrGersl%2FVPOJM7nQRe.png?alt=media&token=632aa007-66a2-4a77-9853-5378cbe8f033" alt="Structural formula of hydrogen peroxide" >}}

- the structural formula is sometimes _condensed_
    - groups of distinct physical or chemical properties are written together
- ex. Condensed strucural formula of hydrogen peroxide
$$HO-OH$$
- it is most commonly used in organic chemistry 
### Molecular formula
- **_molecular formulae_** denote only the numbers of atoms in the substance
- ex. Molecular formula of hydrogen peroxide
$$H_2O_2$$
- it is most commonly used in inorganic chemistry
### Empirical formula
- **_empirical formulae_** denote only the most simplified ratios of individual atoms compared to one another
- it is based on simple observations of an unknown substance (hence the name) that determine which atoms can be found in a substance
- it also obeys the _law od definite proportions_
> The simple ratio of atoms in any sample of a pure substance is always preserved.
- ex. Empirical formula of hydrogen peroxide
$$HO$$
- it omits all structural descriptors and thus can lead to confusion and misrepresentation
## Mass fraction $w$
- **_mass fraction_** tells us the fraction of mass a component of a substance takes up

$$w_i=\cfrac{m_i}{m}$$

- where:
    - $w_i$ is the _mass fraction of substance_ $i$
    - $m_i$ is the _actual mass of substance_ $i$
    - $m$ is the _actual mass of the whole sample_
