# Definitions
- **_mixture_** is a composition of two or more pure substances
- **_phase_** is a part of a mixture with distinguishible chemical and/or physical properties
# Homogeneous mixtures
- **_homogeneous mixture_** is a mixture with only one phase
- homogeneous mixtures created via dissolving a solid or gaseous substance in liquid is called a _solution_
    - in equations, it is usually written as $\odot$ (pronounced "sol")
    - solutions can technically be solid (e.g. steel - homogeneous mixture of carbon and steel), but they are usually refered to differently (e.g. alloys)
# Heterogeneous mixtures
- **_heterogeneous mixture_** is a mixture with two or more phases
- the two phases of this type of mixture are clearly distinguishible by naked eye (e.g. oil in water)
# Colloids
- **_colloid_** is a mixture with two or more phases which are not easily distinguishible by naked eye
- more complex machines ought to be used to determine whether a mixture is homogeneous or colloidal
