# Review
The book provides a very solid basis for further studying general and inorganic chemistry. There is no useless information and the text is very well structurized. The content is devided carefully into chapters. The best thing about this book is the lack of confusing metaphors and oversimplifying. The biggest flaw of this book in my opinion is the lack of information about the individul elements of the periodic table, thus I don't believe it can really be used as the only source for studying inorganic chemistry. It is still great for general chemistry though. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to start learning chemistry on a new level.
