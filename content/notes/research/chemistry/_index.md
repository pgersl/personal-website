# Introduction
## TL;DR
I decided to study chemistry approximately 2 years ago. This was when covid hit the bucket and with loads of free time, I decided to invest it into chemistry. I started slow and didn't really make that much progress. Then, after the summer holiday and basicaly after covid, I enrolled to a course that motivated me extremely and so I did all highschool chemistry with some university level chemistry in just one year and loved it. I also participated in [chemistry olympiad](https://olympiada.vscht.cz/cs/) (which went poorly) and grinded through the topics of this olympiad like crazy.

I mostly enjoy biochemistry, because it's the most practical field of chemistry I think. The other fields are too theoretical for me and inorganic chemistry for example doesn't really have a future. As Peter Thiel once said: "_I think geography, basic [inorganic] chemistry are areas that have been fully explored, these are areas where you are not going to find any secrets, these are not promissing areas where you will discover..._" (watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFZrL1RiuVI&t=835s)). Biochemistry and certain parts of organic chemistry have a future, especially in relation to ecology and somatology. There are still many secrets to unvail in these fields and still new technology to create.
## Why study chemistry?
### Philosophical perspective
I believe that every concious living being should explore the world around them. There are many ways to look at the world around you and chemistry is only one of them. Chemistry though provides the most detailed view. Surely, you can't really understand much without the other sciences, but the other sciences only look at the "bigger picture". A biologit might observe that a cell replicated, a phisicist might conclude that energy and matter must have been released or added for the process to occure. But how the matter got there? What is the matter composed of? How does a cell generate energy? These are the fundamental questions that need to be answered in order to fully understand the concept of cell replication and no one else but a chemist can provide an answer to each one of them.

Chemistry explores the world around us in the most fundamental way. It describes why objects have the properties they do and what they are made of. Based on these, chemistry also enables us to create more of something just by knowing the composition of the thing we want to create.
### Bussiness incentive
Chemistry is the science of the future. It is the chemists who do research in medicine, who develop more and more unreal materials for applications we can't currently imagine, who will probably fix the technological problems we face today (climate change, transport, computational power). Chemistry will be the field where people discover new things that will be useful to us all. Chemistry will be the field where the money will roll. Be prepared and understand it.
## How to study chemistry?
### Preliminaries
#### Physics
Physics and chemistry are two very deeply intertwined sciences. It is useful to understand the concepts of **electromagnetism** and **thermodynamics**. You don't have to understand these topics deeply, just understand the basic concepts. Also know the distinction between chemistry and physics before you start. Physics explains how things work on the macro-level, chemistry explains what exactly causes these effects on the micro-level.
#### Maths
Math used in chemistry isn't really complicated. There is obviously some very complicated and interesting math after the orbital theory of the structure of atoms, but this math is very advanced and if you are not planning to study theoretical physics or chemistry, you are probably not going to encounter it in the future. For you, just knowing how to work with **fractions** properly is enough. In order to understand concepts such as radioactivity, you need to understand the basics of **exponential growth and decline**.  **Functions** in general can be very useful for chemical analysis.
#### Biology
General biology is a must-have skill when studying chemistry, especially biochemistry. You can't really study biochemistry without having some insight into **somatology, plant morphology and anatomy and cytology**. These areas are essential. In somatology, focus primarily on **genetics, digestive system, vascular system and nervous system**.  In plant anatomy, focus primarily on how the plants are **structured** and how substances are **transfered** in the body of the plant. Pay good attention to the **structure of leaves**. Understand what **different parts of the cell do**. Know where they are and what they are made of (generally).
#### Mindset
Before studying chemistry, you should have the right mindset. You should know a few things before you start:
- **Chemistry is important**

[Read above](#why-study-chemistry).
- **Chemistry is massive**

You will never everything about every part of chemistry. You will never know every property of an element of the periodic table. You will never write down every reaction a substance can figure in. Chemistry is a ginormous subject and there is no way you can learn everything. Throughout your chemical journey, you will find subjects that don't interest you, you will find areas that spark something in you. In those areas you will find fields that are most exciting to you and of those fields, you'll eventually choose one, one that you are going to focus on. 

Believe me. I used to think that scientists were these masterminds who know everything about everything but that's not true. I met a scientist not that long ago who was an expert in nanotechnology an she told me something about silver nanoparticles being dangerous (they kill cells by sticking to their nucleus and making the cell use all it's energy to try and get it out (which never happens :laughing: )). I then asked her something I thought to be quiet simple, how does lead kill. She couldn't answer. Not because she was stupid, but because she chose a different field and kept her mind off everything else. That's how it goes.
- **Chemistry is hard**

Most concepts in chemistry are rather easy to understand. Everything has a logical place and isn't there just because. Some concepts are very abstract, especially when talking about the structure of atoms and they are thus hard to understand. They usually envolve loads of advanced physics and quantum chemistry and no one is bothered to properly explain that.

Chemistry is also a descriptive science. Chemistry isn't constructed on some basic axiomatic truths and or simple rules (debatable for sure, argue me) like maths or languages are. Chemistry describes reality as is and because of that, there is a lot to remember. Some parts of chemistry have been corrupted by historic conventions and biologists. These two things make it much harder to give names to substances (trivial nomenclature, traditional symbols).
### What to study?
#### General chemistry
##### What is it about?
General chemistry is basically all the theory behind all other chemistry. It is essential for further studying chemistry.

You'll learn:
- **the definitions of basic properties of elements and other substances** (_electronegativity, ionizing energy_)
- **general structure of atoms and molecules** (_atomic nucleus, electron shell (and its history), valence electrons, chemical bonds, hybridization, VSEPR, mixtures_)
- **basic mechanism of all chemical reactions** (_redox reactions, acid-base reactions, chemical kinetics, chemical thermodynamics_) 
- **how to work with and write chemical reactions** (_stoichiometry_)
- **electrochemistry** (_noble nad non-noble metals, batteries, applications of redox reactions_)
- **radiochemistry** (_radioactivity, nuclear reactors_)
- **how to analyse an unknown substance** (_qualitative and quantitative analysis_)
##### Will it be useful?
General chemistry is always useful. Using the stuff you learn you can predict the properties of inorganic and organic compounds.
#### Inorganic chemistry
##### What is it about?
Inorganic chemistry defines the system for naming chemical substances and elements. It organizes chemical elements into the periodic system based on their properties. It introduces to the concept of division of elements into metals, half-metals and non-metals. Mainly it describes all the elements there are.

You'll learn:
- **how the periodic table of elements works** (_organization of elements based on their properties_)
- **the classification of elements**
- **uses for every element** (_industrial uses, biological relevance_)
##### Will it be useful?
Inorganic chemistry is interesting but all the secrets have been uncovered. Today, people doing inorganic chemistry are not really learning new things but more they are developing new materials used in very specific ares of the industry. The new exciting area of inorganic chemistry is nanotechnology which definitely has a future and is a field to explore. It is definitely useful to know basics of inorganic chemistry to orient properly in the periodic table and to know the basic properties of elements.
#### Organic and biochemistry
##### What is it about?
Organic chemistry is the study of carbon, it's more complex compounds to be precise. Biochemistry studies the groups of these more complex compounds of carbon that build living beings and how these compounds interact with one another and make energy. The two are deeply intertwined and you can't do one without the other sneeking in, that's why they are in the same category here.

You'll learn:
- **what is carbon** (_physical and chemical properties of carbon, how carbon bonds, why carbon is THE element of organic chemistry_)
- **the nomenclature of organic chemistry** (_how to name stuff, why is there chaos in the naming system_)
- **how organic compounds interact with one another and themselves** (_isomers, substitution, addition, elimination, polymerization, condensation, isomerization, redox reactions in organic chemistry, mono and bimolecular reactions, homolysis and heterolysis, radicals, nucleophiles, electrophiles, polarity, induction effect, mesomeric effect, catalysis in organic cehmistry_)
- **the classification of carbohydrates** (_alkanes, alkenes, alkynes and their cyclic versions, polyenes, polyynes and their cyclic versions, arenes_)
- **how carbohydrates are extracted** (_crude oil, coal, natural gas, fracking, distillation_)
- **the classification of carbohydrate derivatives** (_halogencarbohydrates, organometalic compounds, alcohols, phenols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and their derivatives, carbonic acid and its derivatives, ntirocarbohydrates, amines, sulfur derivatives_)
- **the chemistry of heterocyclic compounds** (_heterocycles with nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur_)
- **how plastics are made** (_polymers, catalysis of polymerization, industrial use and production of plastics_)
- **descriptive biochemistry** (_what is biochemistry, sugars, fats, peptides, proteins, enzymes, hormones, vitamins, isoprenoids, nucleic acids, alkaloids (i.e. drugs)_)
- **bioinorganic chemistry** (_what metals do in living tissue, how come you can breath_)
- **dynamic biochemistry** (_metabolism - its function, products, regulation, how photosynthesis works, why fats are better energy sources than sugars_)
##### Will it be useful?
Organic chemistry and biochemistry are the sciences of now and the future. They will always be just for the fact that diseases exist. There is always going to be a need for biochemists who fill find vaccines and drugs for them. There is still a lot of unexplored in the field of organic chemistry and there should always be more, because the number of compounds carbon can make is practically infinite and there is so much to learn about each one of them. There are processes in your body that we can't fully explain now, so those are even more secrets to unravel. We don't know how to extract safely the huge amounts of fossil fuels we have under our feet. We don't know how to capture carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) from the atmosphere cheaply. These are the fields that most interest me personally.

These topics are just a very short insight into the wonders of chemistry and there is definitely more to learn. Just so you know what you're getting yourself into.
### What to use?
#### Textbooks
##### For English students
I personally don't have an experience with English textbooks of chemistry. What I can say generally is this: **Use an older textbook**.

New textbooks are simply bad, unorganized and too colorful. You want a black and white textbook with plain text and some infographics where necessary. You want it to be autistically structured. These textbooks were made up to the 1980s I think. You know it's a good textbook when a chapter is called _Catalytic polymerization of alkene monomers_ and not _How the modern guitar strings are made? HMMMM?_. Obviously, an older textbook might contain older information, but don't use a newer textbook just because of that. If there is a sentence ending in _we currently don't understand_ or _we currently don't have enough information_, just check with the online sources. If some info seems outdated or is contradictory with another source, check online as well.
##### For czech students
Všechny zdroje, které jsou vypsány níže jsou výběrem toho možná nejlepšího, co na českém trhu je. Já osobně jsem začínal se **Souhrnnými texty od Streblové**, ale zpětně bych si asi vybral **trojdílnou sérii učebnic pro gymnázia od Marečka a Honzy**. Dá vám perfektní kostru celé chemie a skvělý úvod do všech jejích oblastí. Souhrnné texty jsou ale také velmi dobré, ovšem neobsahují tak obrovské množství zajímavých informací navíc jako učebnice od Marečka a Honzy. Učebnice, se kterými zatím nemám zkušenost, ale měly by být dost dobré, jsou **učebnice Pavla Kloudy** (momentálně mám jen Základy biochemie a k práci s nimi jsem se ještě nedostal, na první pohled vypadají dost dobře).

Poté už se můžete ponořit do oceánu vysokoškolských skript. Na anorganickou chemii doporučuji skripta od **Klikorky** a od **Lukeše**. Skripta od **Jursíka** a od **Toužína** jsou také velmi dobrá, ale jejich způsob předání informací mi osobně vyhovuje méně než u předcházejících dvou. Toužín navíc není zrovna pěkně strukturovaný a je náročnější se ve skriptech zorientovat.

Se skripty na organickou chemii zatím nemám příliš velkou zkušenost. Zatím jsem pracoval pouze se skripty od **Svobody** (_Organická chemie I._), ovšem to bylo pouze pro jeden projekt. Obsahují ale velmi přehledný souhrn celé teoretické a části praktické organické chemie (stejný kolektiv autorů napsal také skirpta k organické syntéze - _Organická syntéza I._). Úchvatná je učebnie organické chemie od **Červinky**. Je skvěle strukturovaná a teoretické organické chemii se věnuje vždy až v momentě kdy její znalosti okamžitě využijete.

Se skripty biochemie nemám žádnou zkušenost. Učebnice, která vypadá zajímavě je **Biochemie** (nebo také **Biochemistry**) od **Donalda a Judth G. Voet**. Je to monstrózní dílo, které má přes 1 300 stran. Obsahuje jak biologický úvod, tak velmi precizně a podrobně popsanou popisnou popisnou biochemii, enzymologii, metabolismus a konečně také genetiku. Jelikož se jedná o americkou učebnici, zbytečným nebo vtipným infografikám se zde nevyhneme, ale není to tak hrozné.

Platí stále ovšem, že pro velmi specifické oblasti je znalost angličtiny esenciální a trh s anglickými učebnicemi chemie je nekonečný. Zároveň není na škodu umět dobře německy, protože Němci jsou na chemii přeborníci a většina největších objevů v chemii se stala v Němcku a byla popsána německými vědci.
#### Online tools
I don't personally enjoy using online tools as much as physical textbooks. I first started learning chemistry through **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-chemistry-beta)**. This might be enough for you if chemistry really isn't your goal but you want a good introduction to understand some topics in other fields. In my point of view, Khan Academy tends to simplify a lot, with chemistry especially, and there still aren't classes for everything. You can then use **[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/browse/physical-science-and-engineering/chemistry)** as a source for some more advanced and specific topics to be used in analysis and research (I didn't manage to find a good theoretical course though). I also tried using **[Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/courses/chemical-reaction/)** for chemistry, but that was just bad. It might be great for maths and physics, but it's rubbish for chemistry.

As a quick reference, you might want to use **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)** (the English version preferably) and as a way to check outdated information mentioned above. For history, **[Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/)** is definitely a useful source. You can read articles about the famous scientists you will stumble upon during your chemistry journey.

These are the sources I've found or used so far, I might add more in the future
##### For czech students
Nástrojů pro online samostudium chemie v češtině není mnoho. Osobně mám zkušenost pouze s youtube kanálem **[Olinium](https://www.youtube.com/c/Olinium)** a **kurzem Olgy Ryparové** (odkaz níže). Kurz je určitě fajn a celá komunita kanálu je velmi fajn a možná vám ukáže, že zájemců o studium chemie není málo. Na youtube kanále je vysvětleno velké množství teoretické chemie, anorganické chemie, organické chemie i biochemie. Mě osobně kurz pomohl v tom, že mě donutil se opravdu chemii věnovat, neuvěřitelně mě to bavilo a jsem za něj rád. Osobně jsem moc často nevyužíval možnost hromadných konzultací k ptaní se na otázky a na "pokec", ale individuální konzultaci jsem využil vždy. Celkově velmi dobrá zkušenost.

Na analytickou chemii je perfektní velmi silně autistická stránka Michaela Canova (odkaz níže). Komentář není možný, stránku je třeba navštívit.
