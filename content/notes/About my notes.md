# Notes you can find here
I make two types of notes. 

The first type is the **[notes from school](/notes/school/)**. I don't make notes from every subject, because I am either not interested or I find the subject to be so utterly useless I can't be bothered to write them. I also don't write many notes from the maths class, since there is usually not that much theory and there is much more practice and I use a physical paper notebook or a small whiteboard to do solve the problems.

I took loads of paper notes in the past and I kept them in an archive of sorts. Of course, I don't have my notes from the first grade, I started archiving these notes since I went to the grammar school I am currently attending. I am planning to rewrite them into markdown in the future and publish them here.

My school notes are organized by subject and not by grade, because I just don't find it that useful to sort them that way. I might also add new notes into these subjects and move them from school notes to the second type.

The second type is **[research notes](/notes/research/)**. These notes I write myself from textbooks I choose to go through from topics of my liking. Currently, that is chemistry, music and English. These notes are much more profound and more linked together. Sources are also listed.

Obviously, **I don't share all my notes here**. I used to take a lot of personal notes (which I might get back into) which were not intended to be shared. I also track my tasks and projects, prepare presentations and take notes for those. These would be useless without context, thus they are not here.   

# How I take notes
I started making my notes digitally in 2020. I experimented with a few tools and here is my experience with them.

At first, I used [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). It was a very popular new tool at that time, it seemed like everybody was using it, and so I tried it as well. It worked great for organising my personal things, like TODOs, long-term projects, habit trackers etc. I used it to take notes from a chemisty textbook and it worked great at first. I was then introduced to another tool though, that would change everything. The problem with Notion was that I couldn't reference other pages very easily. I don't know how it works now, but I don't think it changed much. My peers then introduced me to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

I used Obsidian for quite a while and I was mindblown. I soon started making all notes in Obsidian. Chemistry, school notes, personal notes, even some recipes, you name it. My peers then switched to [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), but I stayed with Obsidian, because I didn't really feel the need to switch and I was lazy going through the whole importing process. I then started to notice the disadvantages of Obsidian. I couldn't view my notes on my phone very easily (I eventually set up a system for that, but I didn't really like it). I couldn't link only to certain parts of my notes (block references in Roam Research). I decided to switch eventually and I started using Roam Research fully. I imported everything, used the daily notes feature, organised tasks and projects, reflected on my work. I use Roam like that to this day. I don't pay for it by the way (I created an account before you had to pay). I think that I am going continue using Roam to organize my personal things, but I will probably not use it to take notes anymore. The biggest disadvantage of Roam Research is the difficulties with sharing your notes. I want to share my notes and my thoughts and I know there are people who would like to use my notes as a reference, or maybe an introduction to a field. I believe there are people who could debate me on my opinions. With Roam, it would be impossible to share these with the world easily, hence the last step of my note-taking journey.

This website is the new way I want to take notes. Notes that will be shared with the world as I write them. Perfect, exactly as I want them to be.

# Mindset
I don't think notes are as important to me as they were in the past. I used to portrait myself as a _non-linear learner_. This horrible term, according to my definition at least, describes a person, who wants to create a second [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) for himself. I think though, that a person like that cares more about linking the notes together than, you know, learning something. I don't want this to be me. I want to create notes that are useful to me and others and while making them, actually learn stuff. I would like to create a database of things I have learned, but I don't want to just blindly rewrite books.

Again, I don't now think that notes are as important as I thought they were in the past. I think that if you don't remember anything and just write notes, you are not learning, you are just writing thousands and thousands of words never to be seen by anyone, not even you. Use you head first, notes are just a quick reference for when you forget something, they are not your _second brain_. If you do already have notes on something, share them, that way, they are much more useful than just sitting there in your **_sYSt3%M_**.

# Language
I live in the Czech Republic. I go to a czech school, I speak czech everyday, I read czech textbooks, so my notes are **primarily in czech**. This isn't very useful for "the world" I keep mentioning, but my articles are going to be in English. I was thinkig that maybe some day, when I have plenty of time and maybe clones of myself, I would translate all my notes to English and my articles to czech and basically create a multilingual website. This might happen when I go turbo-autistic someday, but not any time soon. For now, czech it is.
